<h1>WASTE</h1>


<p>At Shapters, <span class="smcap">George Farrant's</span> house in Hertfordshire.
Ten o'clock on a Sunday evening in summer.</p>

<p><i>Facing you at her piano by the window, from which she
is protected by a little screen, sits</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>;
<i>a woman of the interesting age, clear-eyed and all
her face serene, except for a little pucker of the brows
which shows a puzzled mind upon some important
matters. To become almost an ideal hostess has been
her achievement; and in her own home, as now, this
grace is written upon every movement. Her eyes
pass over the head of a girl, sitting in a low chair by
a little table, with the shaded lamplight falling on her
face. This is</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>; <i>twenty-three, undefeated
in anything as yet and so unsoftened. The
book on her lap is closed, for she has been listening
to the music. It is possibly some German philosopher,
whom she reads with a critical appreciation of
his shortcomings. On the sofa near her lounges</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell</span>; <i>a charming woman, if by charming
you understand a woman who converts every quality
she possesses into a means of attraction, and has no use
for any others. On the sofa opposite sits</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trebell</span>.
<i>In a few years, when her hair is quite grey,
she will assume as by right the dignity of an old maid.
Between these two in a low armchair is</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>.
<i>She has attained to many dignities. Mother
and grandmother, she has brought into the world
and nourished not merely life but character. A
wonderful face she has, full of proud memories and
fearless of the future. Behind her, on a sofa between
the windows, is</i> <span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. <i>He is just what
the average English father would like his son to be.
You can see the light shooting out through the
windows and mixing with moonshine upon a
smooth lawn. On your left is a door. There are
many books in the room, hardly any pictures, a
statuette perhaps. The owner evidently sets beauty
of form before beauty of colour. It is a woman's
room and it has a certain delicate austerity. By the
time you have observed everything</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>
<i>has played Chopin's prelude opus 28, number 20
from beginning to end.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Thank you, my dear Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Protesting.</i>] No more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I won't play for a moment longer than
I feel musical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Trebell</span>. Do you think it right, Julia, to finish
with that after an hour's Bach?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I suddenly came over Chopinesque,
Fanny; ... what's your objection? [<i>as she sits by her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. What ... when Bach has raised
me to the heights of unselfishness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Grimacing sweetly, her eyes only
half lifted.</i>] Does he? I'm glad that I don't understand
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Putting mere prettiness in its
place.</i>] One may prefer Chopin when one is young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. And is that a reproach or a compliment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Boldly.</i>] I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Or a man may ... unless he's a
philosopher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>To the rescue.</i>] Miss Trebell,
you're very hard on mere humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Completing the reproof.</i>] That's
my wretched training as a schoolmistress, Lady Davenport
... one grew to fear it above all things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>Throwing in the monosyllable
with sharp youthful enquiry.</i>] Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. There were no text books on the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Smiling at her friend.</i>] Yes, Fanny ...
I think you escaped to look after your brother only just
in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. In another year I might have been
head-mistress, which commits you to approve of the
system for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Shaking her wise head.</i>] I've
watched the Education fever take England....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. If I hadn't stopped teaching things
I didn't understand...!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Not without mischief.</i>] And what
was the effect on the pupils?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. I can tell you that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Frances never taught you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. No, I wish she had. But I was at
her sort of a school before I went to Newnham. I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Very distastefully.</i>] Up-to-date, it
was described as.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. Well, it was like a merry-go-round
at top speed. You felt things wouldn't look a bit like that
when you came to a standstill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. And they don't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>With great decision.</i>] Not a
bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>In her velvet tone.</i>] I was taught
the whole duty of woman by a parson-uncle who disbelieved
in his Church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. When a man at Jude's was going to
take orders....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Jude's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. At Oxford. The dons went very
gingerly with him over bits of science and history.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>This wakes a fruitful thought in</i> <span class="smcap">Julia Farrant's</span>
<i>brain.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Mamma, have you ever discussed so-called
anti-Christian science with Lord Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span> ... Cantelupe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Yes. It was over appointing a teacher
for the schools down here ... he was staying with us. The
Vicar's his fervent disciple. However, we were consulted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. Didn't Lord Charles want you to
send the boys there till they were ready for Harrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Quite the last thing in Toryism!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Mamma made George say we were
too <i>nouveau riche</i> to risk it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>As she laughs.</i>] I couldn't resist that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Catching something of her subject's
dry driving manner.</i>] Lord Charles takes the superior
line and says ... that with his consent the Church may
teach the unalterable Truth in scientific language or
legendary, whichever is easier understanded of the people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Is it the prospect of Disestablishment
suddenly makes him so accommodating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>With large contempt.</i>] He needn't
be. The majority of people believe the world was made
in an English week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. No Bishop dare deny it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>From the heights of experience.</i>] Dear
Lucy, do you seriously think that the English spirit&mdash;the
nerve that runs down the backbone&mdash;is disturbed by new
theology ... or new anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Enjoying her epigram.</i>] What a
waste of persecution history shows us!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span> <i>now captures the conversation with a
very young politician's fervour.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Once they're disestablished they must
make up their minds what they do believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. I presume Lord Charles thinks
it'll hand the Church over to him and his ... dare I say
'Sect'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Won't it? He knows what he wants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Subtly.</i>] There's the election to come
yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. But now both parties are pledged to a
bill of some sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Political prophecies have a knack of
not coming true; but, d'you know, Cyril Horsham warned
me to watch this position developing ... nearly four years
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Sitting on the opposition bench
sharpens the eye-sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Ironically.</i>] Has he been pleased with
the prospect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>With perfect diplomacy</i>] If the
Church must be disestablished ... better done by its
friends than its enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Still I don't gather he's pleased
with his dear cousin Charles's conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Shrugging.</i>] Oh, lately, Lord Charles
has never concealed his tactics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. And that speech at Leeds was the
crowning move I suppose; just asking the Nonconformists
to bring things to a head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Judicially.</i>] I think that was precipitate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Giving them</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Charles's</span> <i>oratory.</i>]
Gentlemen, in these latter days of Radical opportunism!&mdash;You
know, I was there ... sitting next to an old gentleman
who shouted "Jesuit."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. But supposing Mallaby and the
Nonconformists hadn't been able to force the Liberals'
hand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Speaking as of inferior beings.</i>]
Why, they were glad of any cry going to the Country!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>As she considers this.</i>] Yes ...
and Lord Charles would still have had as good a chance of
forcing Lord Horsham's. It has been clever tactics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>Who has been listening, sharp-eyed.</i>]
Contrariwise, he wouldn't have liked a Radical Bill
though, would he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>With aplomb.</i>] He knew he was safe
from that. The government must have dissolved before
Christmas anyway ... and the swing of the pendulum's a
sure thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>With her smile.</i>] It's never a sure
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Oh, Mrs. Farrant, look how unpopular
the Liberals are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. What made them bring in Resolutions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Overflowing with knowledge of the
subject.</i>] I was told Mallaby insisted on their showing
they meant business. I thought he was being too clever
... and it turns out he was. Tommy Luxmore told
me there was a fearful row in the Cabinet about it.
But on their last legs, you know, it didn't seem to matter,
I suppose. Even then, if Prothero had mustered up an
ounce of tact ... I believe they could have pulled them
through....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Not the Spoliation one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Well, Mr. Trebell dished that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Henry says his speech didn't
turn a vote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>With charming irony.</i>] How disinterested
of him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Enthusiastic.</i>] That speech did if ever
a speech did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Is there any record of a speech that
ever did? He just carried his own little following with
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. But the crux of the whole matter is
and has always been ... what's to be done with the
Church's money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>Visualising sovereigns.</i>] A hundred
millions or so ... think of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. There has been from the start a
good deal of anti-Nonconformist feeling against applying
the money to secular uses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Deprecating false modesty, on anyone's
behalf.</i>] Oh, of course the speech turned votes ... twenty
of them at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>Determined on information.</i>] Then
I was told Lord Horsham had tried to come to an understanding
himself with the Nonconformists about Disestablishment&mdash;oh&mdash;a
long time ago ... over the Education
Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Is that true, Julia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. How should I know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>With some mischief</i>] You might.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Weighing her words.</i>] I don't think
it would have been altogether wise to make advances.
They'd have asked more than a Conservative government
could possibly persuade the Church to give up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. I don't see that Horsham's much better
off now. He only turned the Radicals out on the Spoliation
question by the help of Trebell. And so far ... I
mean, till this election is over Trebell counts still as one of
them, doesn't he, Miss Trebell? Oh ... perhaps he
doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. He'll tell you he never has counted
as one of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. No doubt Lord Charles would sooner
have done without his help. And that's why I didn't ask
the gentle Jesuit this week-end if anyone wants to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Stupent at this lack of party spirit.</i>]
What ... he'd rather have had the Liberals go to the
country undefeated!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>With finesse.</i>] The election may
bring us back independent of Mr. Trebell and anything
he stands for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Sharply.</i>] But you asked Lord
Horsham to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>With still more finesse.</i>] I had my
reasons. Votes aren't everything.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span> <i>has been listening with rather a
doubtful smile; she now caps the discussion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. I'm relieved to hear you say so, my
dear Julia. On the other hand democracy seems to have
brought itself to a pretty pass. Here's a measure, which
the country as a whole neither demands nor approves
of, will certainly be carried, you tell me, because a minority
on each side is determined it shall be ... for totally
different reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Shrugging again.</i>] It isn't our business
to prevent popular government looking foolish,
Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Is that Tory cynicism or feminine?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this moment</i> <span class="smcap">George Farrant</span> <i>comes through
the window; a good natured man of forty-five. He
would tell you that he was educated at Eton and
Oxford. But the knowledge which saves his life
comes from the thrusting upon him of authority and
experience; ranging from the management of an
estate which he inherited at twenty-four, through
the chairmanship of a newspaper syndicate, through
a successful marriage, to a minor post in the last
Tory cabinet and the prospect of one in the near-coming
next. Thanks to his agents, editors, permanent
officials, and his own common sense, he always
acquits himself creditably. He comes to his
wife's side and waits for a pause in the conversation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. I remember Mr. Disraeli once
said to me ... Clever women are as dangerous to the State
as dynamite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Not to be impressed by Disraeli.</i>]
Well, Lady Davenport, if men will leave our intellects
lying loose about....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Blackborough's going, Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Yes, George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Concluding her little apologue to</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Trebell</span>.] Yes, my dear, but power without responsibility
isn't good for the character that wields it
either.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>There follows</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>through the window a man
of fifty. He has about him that unmistakeable air
of acquired wealth and power which distinguishes
many Jews and has therefore come to be regarded as a
solely Jewish characteristic. He speaks always with
that swift decision which betokens a narrowed view.
This is</i> <span class="smcap">Russell Blackborough</span>; <i>manufacturer,
politician ... statesman, his own side calls him.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>To his hostess.</i>] If I start now,
they tell me, I shall get home before the moon goes down.
I'm sorry I must get back to-night. It's been a most
delightful week-end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Gracefully giving him a good-bye
hand.</i>] And a successful one, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. We talked Education for half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Her eyebrows lifting a shade.</i>] Education!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Then Trebell went away to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. I've missed the music, I fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. But it's been Bach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. No Chopin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. For a minute only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Why don't these new Italian men
write things for the piano! Good-night, Lady Davenport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>As he bows over her hand.</i>] And
what has Education to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Non-committal himself.</i>] Perhaps it
was a subject that compromised nobody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Do you think my daughter has been
wasting her time and her tact?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Clapping him on the shoulder.</i>] Blackborough's
frankly flabbergasted at the publicity of this
intrigue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Intrigue! Mr. Trebell walked across
the House ... actually into your arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>With a certain dubious grimness.</i>]
Well ... we've had some very interesting talks since. And
his views upon Education are quite ... Utopian. Good
bye, Miss Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I wouldn't be so haughty till after the
election, if I were you, Mr. Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Indifferently.</i>] Oh, I'm glad he's
with us on the Church question ... so far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. So far as you've made up your minds?
The electoral cat will jump soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>A little beaten by such polite cynicism.</i>]
Well ... our conservative principles! After all we know
what they are. Good-night, Mrs. O'Connell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Your neuralgia better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. By fits and starts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Robustly.</i>] Come and play billiards. Horsham
and Maconochie started a game. They can neither
of them play. We left them working out a theory of angles
on bits of paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Professor Maconochie lured me on to
golf yesterday. He doesn't suffer from theories about
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>With approval.</i>] Started life as a
caddie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>Pulling a wry face.</i>] So he told me
after the first hole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. What's this, Kent, about Trebell's
making you his secretary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. He thinks he'll have me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Almost reprovingly.</i>] No question
of politics?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. More intrigue, Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>With disarming candour.</i>] The truth
is, you see, I haven't any as yet. I was Socialist at
Oxford ... but of course that doesn't count. I think I'd
better learn my job under the best man I can find ... and
who'll have me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Gravely.</i>] What does your father
say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Oh, as long as Jack will inherit the
property in a Tory spirit! My father thinks it my wild
oats.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A Footman has come in.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Footman</span>. Your car is round, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Ah! Good-night, Miss Davenport.
Good-bye again, Mrs. Farrant ... a charming week-end.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He makes a business-like departure</i>, <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>follows
him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Footman</span>. A telephone message from Dr. Wedgecroft,
ma'am. His thanks; they stopped the express for
him at Hitchin and he has reached London quite
safely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Thank you.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>The Footman goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span> <i>exhales
delicately as if the air were a little refined by</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough's</span>
<i>removal.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Mr. Blackborough and his patent
turbines and his gas engines and what not are the motive
power of our party nowadays, Fanny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Yes, you claim to be steering
plutocracy. Do you never wonder if it isn't steering you?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell</span>, <i>growing restless, has wandered
round the room picking at the books in their cases.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I always like your books, Julia. It's
an intellectual distinction to know someone who has read
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. That's the Communion I choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Aristocrat ... fastidious aristocrat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. No, now. Learning's a great leveller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. But Julia ... books are quite
unreal. D'you think life is a bit like them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. They bring me into touch with ... Oh,
there's nothing more deadening than to be boxed into a set
in Society! Speak to a woman outside it ... she doesn't
understand your language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. And do you think by prattling
Hegel with Gilbert Wedgecroft when he comes to physic
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Joyously.</i>] Excellent physic that is.
He never leaves a prescription.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Don't you think an aristocracy of
brains is the best aristocracy, Miss Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>With a little more bitterness than
the abstraction of the subject demands.</i>] I'm sure it is just
as out of touch with humanity as any other ... more so,
perhaps. If I were a country I wouldn't be governed by
arid intellects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Manners, Frances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I'm one myself and I know.
They're either dead or dangerous.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">George Farrant</span> <i>comes back and goes straight to</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Still robustly.</i>] Billiards, Mrs. O'Connell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Declining sweetly.</i>] I think not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Billiards, Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>As robust as he.</i>] Yes, Uncle
George. You shall mark while Walter gives me twenty-five
and I beat him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. [<i>With a none-of-your-impudence air.</i>]
I'll give you ten yards start and race you to the billiard
room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. Will you wear my skirt? Oh ...
Grandmamma's thinking me vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Without prejudice.</i>] Why, my dear,
freedom of limb is worth having ... and perhaps it fits
better with freedom of tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>In the proper avuncular tone.</i>] I'll play
you both ... and I'd race you both if you weren't so disgracefully
young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span> <i>has reached an open window.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I shall go for a walk with my
neuralgia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Poor thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. The moon's good for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. Shall you come, Aunt Julia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>In flat protest.</i>] No, I will not sit
up while you play billiards.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell</span> <i>goes out through the one window,
stands for a moment, wistfully romantic, gazing at</i>

lawn.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Horsham still arguing with Maconochie.
They're got to Botany now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span>. Demonstrating something with a ...
what's that thing?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Walter</span> <i>goes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>With a throw of his head towards the distant</i>
<span class="smcap">Horsham</span>.] He was so bored with our politics ...
having to give his opinion too. We could just hear your
piano.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>And he follows</i> <span class="smcap">Walter</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Take Amy O'Connell that lace thing,
will you, Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy Davenport</span>. [<i>Her tone expressing quite wonderfully
her sentiments towards the owner.</i>] Don't you think she'd
sooner catch cold?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She catches it up and follows the two men; then after
looking round impatiently, swings off in the direction</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell</span> <i>took. The three women now
left together are at their ease.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Did you expect Mr. Blackborough
to get on well with Henry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. He has become a millionaire by
appreciating clever men when he met them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Yes, Julia, but his political conscience
is comparatively new-born.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Well, Mamma, can we do without Mr.
Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Everyone seems to think you'll
come back with something of a majority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>A little impatient.</i>] What's the good
of that? The Bill can't be brought into the Lords ... and
who's going to take Disestablishment through the Commons
for us? Not Eustace Fowler ... not Mr. Blackborough
... not Lord Charles ... not George!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Warningly.</i>] Not all your brilliance
as a hostess will keep Mr. Trebell in a Tory Cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>With wilful avoidance of the point.</i>]
Cyril Horsham is only too glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Because you tell him he ought
to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Coming to the rescue.</i>] There is
this. Henry has never exactly called himself a Liberal.
He really is elected independently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I wonder will all the garden-cities
become pocket-boroughs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I think he has made a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. It makes things easier now ... his
having kept his freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I think it's a mistake to stand
outside a system. There's an inhumanity in that
amount of detachment ...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Brilliantly.</i>] I think a statesman may
be a little inhuman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>With keenness.</i>] Do you mean
superhuman? It's not the same thing, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Most people don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Proceeding with her cynicism.</i>] Humanity
achieves ... what? Housekeeping and children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. As far as a woman's concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>A little mockingly.</i>] Now, Mamma,
say that is as far as a woman's concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. My dear, you know I don't think
so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. We may none of us think so. But
there's our position ... bread and butter and a certain
satisfaction until ... Oh, Mamma, I wish I were like
you ... beyond all the passions of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>With great vitality.</i>] I'm nothing
of the sort. It's my egoism's dead ... that's an intimation
of mortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I accept the snub. But I wonder what
I'm to do with myself for the next thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Help Lord Horsham to govern the
country.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Julia Farrant</span> <i>gives a little laugh and takes up the
subject this time.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Mamma ... how many people, do
you think, believe that Cyril's <i>grande passion</i> for me takes
that form?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. Everyone who knows Cyril and
most people who know you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Otherwise I seem to have fulfilled my
mission in life. The boys are old enough to go to school.
George and I have become happily unconscious of each
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>With sudden energy of mind.</i>]
Till I was forty I never realised the fact that most
women must express themselves through men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>a little curiously.</i>]
Didn't your instinct lead you to marry ... or did you fight
against it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I don't know. Perhaps I had no
vitality to spare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. That boy is a long time proposing
to Lucy.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This effectually startles the other two from their
conversational reverie.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Walter? I'm not sure that he means
to. She means to marry him if he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Has she told you so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. No. I judge by her business-like
interest in his welfare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. He's beginning to feel the responsibility
of manhood ... doesn't know whether to be frightened
or proud of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. It's a pretty thing to watch young
people mating. When they're older and marry from
disappointment or deliberate choice, thinking themselves
so worldly-wise....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>, [<i>Back to her politely cynical mood.</i>]
Well ... then at least they don't develop their differences
at the same fire-side, regretting the happy time when
neither possessed any character at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Giving a final douche of common
sense.</i>] My dear, any two reasonable people ought to be
able to live together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Granted three sitting rooms.
That'll be the next middle-class political cry ... when
women are heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Suddenly as practical as her mother.</i>]
Walter's lucky ... Lucy won't stand any nonsense. She'll
have him in the Cabinet by the time he's fifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. And are you the power behind your
brother, Miss Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Gravely.</i>] He ignores women.
I've forced enough good manners on him to disguise the
fact decently. His affections are two generations
ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. People like him in an odd sort of way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. That's just respect for work done ... one
can't escape from it.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is a slight pause in their talk. By some not
very devious route</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant's</span> <i>mind travels to
the next subject.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Fanny ... how fond are you of Amy
O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. She says we're great friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. She says that of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. It's a pity about her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Almost provokingly.</i>] What about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. It seems to be understood that he
treats her badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>A little malicious.</i>] Is there any
particular reason he should treat her well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Don't you like her, Lady Davenport?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>Dealing out justice.</i>] I find her
quite charming to look at and talk to ... but why shouldn't
Justin O'Connell live in Ireland for all that? I'm going to
bed, Julia.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She collects her belongings and gets up.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I must look in at the billiard room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I won't come, Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. What's your brother working at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I don't know. Something we
shan't hear of for a year, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. On the Church business, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Did you hear Lord Horsham at
dinner on the lack of dignity in an irreligious state?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Poor Cyril ... he'll have to find a way
round that opinion of his now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Does he like leading his party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>After due consideration.</i>] It's an intellectual
exercise. He's the right man, Fanny. You see
it isn't a party in the active sense at all, except now and
then when it's captured by someone with an axe to grind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. [<i>Humorously.</i>] Such as my brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>As humorous.</i>] Such as your brother.
It expresses the thought of the men who aren't taken in by
the claptrap of progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. Sometimes they've a queer way of
expressing their love for the people of England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. But one must use democracy. Wellington
wouldn't ... Disraeli did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span>. [<i>At the door.</i>] Good-night, Miss
Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>. I'm coming ... it's past eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>At the window.</i>] What a gorgeous
night! I'll come in and kiss you, Mamma.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>follows</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Davenport</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>
<i>starts across the lawn to the billiard room....
An hour later you can see no change in the room
except that only one lamp is alight on the table in
the middle.</i> <span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Henry Trebell</span>
<i>walk past one window and stay for a moment in the
light of the other. Her wrap is about her shoulders.
He stands looking down at her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. There goes the moon ... it's quieter
than ever now. [<i>She comes in.</i>] Is it very late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>As he follows.</i>] Half-past twelve.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>is hard-bitten, brainy, forty-five and very
sure of himself. He has a cold keen eye, which
rather belies a sensitive mouth; hands which can
grip, and a figure that is austere.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I ought to be in bed. I suppose
everyone has gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Early trains to-morrow. The billiard room
lights are out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. The walk has just tired me comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Sit down. [<i>She sits by the table. He sits
by her and says with the air of a certain buyer at a market.</i>]
You're very pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. As well here as by moonlight? Can't
you see any wrinkles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. One or two ... under the eyes. But they
give character and bring you nearer my age. Yes,
Nature hit on the right curve in making you.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She stretches herself, cat-like.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Praise is the greatest of luxuries, isn't
it, Henry? ... Henry ... [<i>she caresses the name.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Quite right ... Henry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Henry ... Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Having formally taken possession of my
name....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I'll go to bed.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>His eyes have never moved from her. Now she
breaks the contact and goes towards the door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I wouldn't ... my spare time for love
making is so limited.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She turns back, quite at ease, her eyes challenging him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. That's the first offensive thing you've
said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Why offensive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I may flirt. Making love's another
matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Sit down and explain the difference ... Mrs.
O'Connell.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She sits down.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Quite so. 'Mrs. O'Connell'. That's
the difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Provokingly.</i>] But I doubt if I'm interested
in the fact that your husband doesn't understand you and
that your marriage was a mistake ... and how hard you
find it to be strong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Kindly.</i>] I'm not quite a fool
though you think so on a three months' acquaintance. But
tell me this ... what education besides marriage does a
woman get?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His head lifting quickly.</i>] Education....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Don't be business-like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Do you think the things you like to
have taught in schools are any use to one when one comes
to deal with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>After a little scrutiny of her-face.</i>] Well,
if marriage is only the means to an end ... what's the end?
Not flirtation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>With an air of self-revelation.</i>] I
don't know. To keep one's place in the world, I suppose,
one's self-respect and a sense of humour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Is that difficult?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. To get what I want, without paying
more than it's worth to me....?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Never to be reckless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>With a side-glance.</i>] One isn't so
often tempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. In fact ... to flirt with life generally. Now,
what made your husband marry you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Dealing with the impertinence in her
own fashion.</i>] What would make you marry me? Don't
say: Nothing on earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Speaking apparently of someone else.</i>] A
prolonged fit of idleness might make me marry ... a clever
woman. But I've never been idle for more than a week.
And I've never met a clever woman ... worth calling a
woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Bringing their talk back to herself,
and fastidiously.</i>] Justin has all the natural instincts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. He's Roman Catholic, isn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. So am I ... by profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It's a poor religion unless you really believe
in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Appealing to him.</i>] If I were to live
at Linaskea and have as many children as God sent,
I should manage to make Justin pretty miserable!
And what would be left of me at all I should like to
know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. So Justin lives at Linaskea alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I'm told now there's a pretty housemaid ... [<i>she shrugs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Does he drink too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Oh, no. You'd like Justin, I daresay.
He's clever. The thirteenth century's what he knows
about. He has done a book on its statutes ... has been
doing another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. And after an evening's hard work I find you
here ready to flirt with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. What have you been working at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. A twentieth century statute perhaps. That's
not any concern of yours either.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She does not follow his thought.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. No, I prefer you in your unprofessional
moments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Real flattery. I didn't know I had any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. That's why you should flirt with me ... Henry ... to
cultivate them. I'm afraid you lack imagination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. One must choose something to lack in this
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Not develop your nature to its utmost
capacity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Well, if that's not an end in itself ...
[<i>With a touch of romantic piety.</i>] I suppose there's the
hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Grimly material.</i>] What, more developing!
I watch people wasting time on themselves with amazement ... I
refuse to look forward to wasting eternity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Shaking her head.</i>] You are very
self-satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Not more so than any machine that runs
smoothly. And I hope not self-conscious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Rather attractively treating him as a
child.</i>] It would do you good to fall really desperately
in love with me ... to give me the power to make you
unhappy.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He suddenly becomes very definite.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. At twenty-three I engaged myself to be
married to a charming and virtuous fool. I broke it off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Did she mind much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. We both minded. But I had ideals of
womanhood that I wouldn't sacrifice to any human being.
Then I fell in with a woman who seduced me, and for a
whole year led me the life of a French novel ... played
about with my emotion as I had tortured that other poor
girl's brains. Education you'd call it in the one case as I
called it in the other. What a waste of time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. And what has become of your
ideal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Relapsing to his former mood.</i>] It's no
longer a personal matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>With coquetry.</i>] You're not interested
in my character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, yes, I am ... up to kissing point.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She does not shrink, but speaks with just a shade of
contempt.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. You get that far more easily than a
woman. That's one of my grudges against men. Why
can't women take love-affairs so lightly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. There are reasons. But make a good
beginning with this one. Kiss me at once.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He leans towards her. She considers him quite
calmly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. When will you, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. When I can't help myself ... if that
time ever comes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Accepting the postponement in a business-like
spirit.</i>] Well ... I'm an impatient man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Confessing engagingly.</i>] I made up
my mind to bring you within arms' length of me when we'd
met at Lady Percival's. Do you remember? [<i>His face
shows no sign of it.</i>] It was the day after your speech on
the Budget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then I remember. But I haven't observed
the process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Subtly.</i>] Your sister grew to like me
very soon. That's all the cunning there has been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The rest is just mutual attraction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. And opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Such as this.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At the drop of their voices they become conscious of
the silent house.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Do you really think everyone has gone
to bed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Disregardful.</i>] And what is it makes my
pressing attentions endurable ... if one may ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Some spiritual need or other, I suppose,
which makes me risk unhappiness ... in fact, welcome
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With great briskness.</i>] Your present need
is a good shaking.... I seriously mean that. You get to
attach importance to these shades of emotion. A slight
physical shock would settle them all. That's why I asked
you to kiss me just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. You haven't very nice ideas, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. There are three facts in life that call up
emotion ... Birth, Death, and the Desire for Children.
The niceties are shams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Then why do you want to kiss me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I don't ... seriously. But I shall in a
minute just to finish the argument. Too much diplomacy
always ends in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. And if I don't fight ... it'd be no
fun for you, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You would get that much good out of me.
For it's my point of honour ... to leave nothing I touch as
I find it.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is very close to her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. You're frightening me a little ...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Come and look at the stars again. Come
along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Give me my wrap ... [<i>He takes it up,
but holds it.</i>] Well, put it on me. [<i>He puts it round her,
but does not withdraw his arms.</i>] Be careful, the stars
are looking at you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, they can't see so far as we can. That's
the proper creed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Softly, almost shyly.</i>] Henry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Bending closer to her.</i>] Yes, pretty thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Is this what you call being in love?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He looks up and listens.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Here's somebody coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Oh!...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. What does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. I'm untidy or something....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She slips out, for they are close to the window. The
</i> <span class="smcap">Footman</span> <i>enters, stops suddenly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Footman</span>. I beg your pardon, sir. I thought
everyone had gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I've just been for a walk. I'll lock up if
you like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Footman</span>. I can easily wait up, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>At the window.</i>] I wouldn't. What do
you do ... just slide the bolt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Footman</span>. That's all, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I see. Good-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Footman</span>. Good-night, sir.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell's</span> <i>demeanour suddenly changes,
becomes alert, with the alertness of a man doing
something in secret. He leans out of the window and
whispers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Amy!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is no answer, so he gently steps out. For a
moment the room is empty and there is silence.
Then</i> <span class="smcap">Amy</span> <i>has flown from him into the safety of
lights. She is flushed, trembling, but rather ecstatic,
and her voice has lost all affectation now.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Oh ... oh ... you shouldn't have
kissed me like that!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>stands in the window-way; a light in his
eyes, and speaks low but commandingly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Come here.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Instinctively she moves towards him. They speak
in whispers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. He was locking up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I've sent him to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. He won't go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Never mind him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. We're standing full in the light ... anyone
could see us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With fierce egotism.</i>] Think of me ... not
of anyone else. [<i>He draws her from the window; then
does not let her go.</i>] May I kiss you again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Her eyes closed.</i>] Yes.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He kisses her. She stiffens in his arms; then
laughs almost joyously, and is commonplace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Well ... let me get my breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Letting her stand free.</i>] Now ... go along.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Obediently she turns to the door, but sinks on the
nearest chair.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. In a minute, I'm a little faint. [<i>He
goes to her quickly.</i>] No, it's nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Come into the air again. [<i>Then half
seriously.</i>] I'll race you across the lawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Still breathless and a little hysterical.</i>]
Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Shall I carry you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Don't be silly. [<i>She recovers her
self-possession, gets up and goes to the window, then looks
back at him and says very beautifully.</i>] But the night's
beautiful, isn't it?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He has her in his arms again, more firmly this
time.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Make it so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Struggling ... with herself</i>] Oh,
why do you rouse me like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Because I want you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Want me to...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Want you to ... kiss me just once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. [<i>Yielding.</i>] If I do ... don't let me
go mad, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Perhaps. [<i>He bends over her, her head drops
back.</i>] Now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy O'Connell</span>. Yes!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She kisses him on the mouth. Then he would
release her, but suddenly she clings again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh ... don't let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With fierce pride of possession.</i>] Not yet.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She is fragile beside him. He lifts her in his arms
and carries her out into the darkness.</i></p></blockquote>

<h2>THE SECOND ACT</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell's</span> house in Queen Anne Street, London. Eleven
o'clock on an October morning.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Trebell's</span> <i>working room is remarkable chiefly for the love
of sunlight it evidences in its owner. The walls are
white; the window which faces you is bare of all but
the necessary curtains. Indeed, lack of draperies
testifies also to his horror of dust. There faces you
besides a double door; when it is opened another door
is seen. When that is opened you discover a writing
table, and beyond can discern a book-case filled with
heavy volumes&mdash;law reports perhaps. The little
room beyond is, so to speak, an under-study. Between
the two rooms a window, again barely curtained,
throws light down the staircase. But in the
big room, while the books are many the choice of
them is catholic; and the book-cases are low, running
along the wall. There is an armchair before the
bright fire, which is on your right. There is a sofa.
And in the middle of the room is an enormous
double writing table piled tidily with much appropriate
impedimenta, blue books and pamphlets and with
an especial heap of unopened letters and parcels.
At the table sits</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>himself, in good health
and spirits, but eyeing askance the work to which he
has evidently just returned. His sister looks in on
him. She is dressed to go out and has a housekeeping
air.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Are you busy, Henry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. More or less. Come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. You'll dine at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Anyone coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Julia Farrant and Lucy have run up to
town, I think. I thought of going round and asking
them to come in ... but perhaps your young man will
be going there. Amy O'Connell said something vague
about our going to Charles Street ... but she may be out
of town by now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well ... I'll be in anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Going to the window as she buttons her
gloves.</i>] Were you on deck early this morning? It must
have been lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, I turned in before we got out of le Havre.
I left Kent on deck and found him there at six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I don't think autumn means to come at all
this year ... it'll be winter one morning. September
has been like a hive of bees, busy and drowsy. By the way,
Cousin Mary has another baby ... a girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Indifferent to the information.</i>] That's the
fourth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Fifth. They asked me down for the
christening ... but I really couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. September's the month for Tuscany. The
car chose to break down one morning just as we were
starting North again; so we climbed one of the little hills
and sat for a couple of hours, while I composed a fifteenth
century electioneering speech to the citizens of Siena.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With a half smile.</i>] Have you a vein of
romance for holiday time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Dispersing the suggestion.</i>] Not at all
romantic ... nothing but figures and fiscal questions.
That was the hardest commercial civilisation there has
been, though you only think of its art and its murders now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. The papers on both sides have been very
full of you ... saying you hold the moral balance ...
or denying it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. An interviewer caught me at Basle. I offered
to discuss the state of the Swiss navy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Was that before Lord Horsham wrote to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes, his letter came to Innsbruck. He
"expressed" it somehow. Why ... it isn't known that
he will definitely ask me to join?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. The Whitehall had a leader before the
Elections were well over to say that he must ... but, of
course, that was Mr. Farrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Knowingly.</i>] Mrs. Farrant. I saw it in
Paris ... it just caught me up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. The Times is very shy over the whole
question ... has a letter from a fresh bishop every day ...
doesn't talk of you very kindly yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Tampering with the Establishment, even
Cantelupe's way, will be a pill to the real old Tory right
to the bitter end.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span> <i>comes in, very fresh and happy-looking.
A young man started in life.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>hails him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Hullo ... you've not been long getting shaved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. How do you do, Miss Trebell? Lucy turned me
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. My congratulations. I've not seen you since
I heard the news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. [<i>Glad and unembarrassed.</i>] Thank you. I do
deserve them, don't I? Mrs. Farrant didn't come down ...
she left us to breakfast together. But I've a message for
you ... her love and she is in town. I went and saw
Lord Charles, sir. He will come to you and be here at
half past seven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Look at these.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He smacks on the back, so to speak, the pile of
parcels and letters.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Oh, lord! ... I'd better start on them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Continuing in her smooth oldmaidish manner.</i>]
Thank you for getting engaged just before you
went off with Henry ... it has given me my only news
of him, through Lucy and your postcards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, what about Wedgecroft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I think it was he spun up just as I'd been let in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, well ... [<i>And he rings at the telephone
which is on his table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. [<i>Confiding in</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trebell</span>.] We're a common
sense couple, aren't we? I offered to ask to stay behind but
she....</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span>, <i>the maid, comes in.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span>. Dr. Wedgecroft, sir.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>is on her heels. If you have an eye for
essentials you may tell at once that he is a doctor, but
if you only notice externals you will take him, for
anything else. He is over forty and in perfect
health of body and spirit. His enthusiasms are his
vitality and he has too many of them ever to lose one.
He squeezes</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Trebell's</span> <i>hand with an air of
fearless affection which is another of his characteristics
and not the least loveable.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. How are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I'm very well, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>, <i>as they shake hands.</i>]
You're looking fit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With tremendous emphasis.</i>] I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You've got the motor eye though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Full of dust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Look at Kent's. [<i>He takes</i> <span class="smcap">Walter's</span>
<i>arm.</i>] It's a slight but serious contraction of the pupil ...
which I charge fifty guineas to cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. It's the eye of faith in you and your homeopathic
doses. Don't you interfere with it.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Frances Trebell</span>, <i>housekeeper, goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>has
seized on the letters and is carrying them to his room.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. This looks like popularity and the great heart
of the people, doesn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Trebell, you're not ill, and I've work to
do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I want ten minutes. Keep anybody out,
Kent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I'll switch that speaking tube arrangement to my
room.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>, <i>overflowing with vitality, starts to face the
floor.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I've seen the last of Pump Court, Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. The Bar ought to give you a testimonial
... to the man who not only could retire on twenty
years' briefs, but has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Fifteen. But I bled the City sharks with a
good conscience ... quite freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>With a pretence at grumbling.</i>] I wish
I could retire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No you don't. Doctoring's a priestcraft ...
you've taken vows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Then why don't you establish <i>our</i>
church instead of ...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes, my friend ... but you're a heretic. I'd
have to give the Medical Council power to burn you at
the stake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. [<i>With the book packages.</i>] Parcel from the
S.P.C.K., sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I know.... Disestablishment a crime against
God; sermon preached by the Vicar of something
Parva in eighteen seventy three. I hope you're aware
it's your duty to read all those.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Suppose they convert me? Lucy wanted to
know if she could see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His eyebrows up.</i>] Yes, I'll call at Mrs.
Farrant's. Oh, wait. Aren't they coming to dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. To-night? No, I think they go back to Shapters
by the five o'clock. I told her she might come round
about twelve on the chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... if Cantelupe's punctual ... I'd sooner
not have too long with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. All right, then.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes, shutting the door; then you hear the door
of his room shut too. The two friends face each
other, glad of a talk.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Well ... you'll never do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes, I shall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You can't carry any bill to be a credit
to you with the coming Tory cabinet on your back. You
know the Government is cursing you with its dying breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Rubbing his hands.</i>] Of course. They've
been beaten out of the House and in now. I suppose they
will meet Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. They must, I think. It's over a month
since&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His thoughts running quickly.</i>] There'll
only be a nominal majority of sixteen against them. The
Labour lot are committed on their side ... and now that
the Irish have gone&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. But they'll be beaten on the Address
first go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... Horsham hasn't any doubt of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. He'll be in office within a week of the
King's speech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With another access of energy.</i>] I'll pull
the bill that's in my head through a Horsham cabinet
and the House. Then I'll leave them ... they'll go to
the country&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You know Percival's pledge about that
at Bristol wasn't very definite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Horsham means to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>With friendly contempt.</i>] Oh, Horsham!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Anyway, it's about Percival I want you.
How ill is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Not very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Is he going to die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Well, I'm attending him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Pinked.</i>] Yes ... that's a good answer.
How does he stomach me in prospect as a colleague, so far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Sir, professional etiquette forbids me
to disclose what a patient may confess in the sweat of
his agony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. He'll be Chancellor again and lead the
House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Why not? He only grumbles that he's
getting old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Thinking busily again.</i>] The difficulty is I
shall have to stay through one budget with them. He'll
have a surplus ... well, it looks like it ... and my only
way of agreeing with him will be to collar it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. But ... good heavens! ... you'll have a
hundred million or so to give away when you've disendowed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Not to give away. I'll sell every penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>With an incredulous grin.</i>] You're
not going back to extending old-age pensions after turning
the unfortunate Liberals out on it, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, no ... none of your half crown measures.
They can wait to round off their solution of that till they've
the courage to make one big bite of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. We shan't see the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Lifting the subject off its feet.</i>] Not if I
come out of the cabinet and preach revolution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Or will they make a Tory of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Acknowledging that stroke with a return grin.</i>]
It'll be said they have when the bill is out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. It's said so already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Who knows a radical bill when he sees it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'm not pleased you have to be running
a tilt against the party system. [<i>He becomes a little
dubious.</i>] My friend ... it's a nasty windmill. Oh,
you've not seen that article in the Nation on Politics and
Society ... it's written at Mrs. Farrant and Lady Lurgashall
and that set. They hint that the Tories would never
have had you if it hadn't been for this bad habit of opposite
party men meeting each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Unimpressed.</i>] Excellent habit! What we
really want in this country is a coalition of all the shibboleths
with the rest of us in opposition ... for five years
only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Smiling generously.</i>] Well, it's a sensation
to see you become arbiter. The Tories are owning
they can't do without you. Percival likes you personally ...
Townsend don't matter ... Cantelupe you buy
with a price, I suppose ... Farrant you can put in your
pocket. I tell you I think the man you may run up against
is Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, all he wants is to be let look big ... and
to have an idea given him when he's going to make a
speech, which isn't often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Otherwise ... I suppose ... now I may
go down to history as having been in your confidence.
I'm very glad you've arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With great seriousness.</i>] I've sharpened
myself as a weapon to this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Kindly.</i>] And you're sure of yourself,
aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Turning his wrist.</i>] Try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Slipping his doctor's fingers over the
the pulse.</i>] Seventy, I should say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I promise you it hasn't varied a beat these
three big months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Well, I wish it had. Perfect balance
is most easily lost. How do you know you've the power of
recovery? ... and it's that gets one up in the morning
day by day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Is it? My brain works steadily on ... hasn't
failed me yet. I keep it well fed. [<i>He breathes deeply.</i>]
But I'm not sure one shouldn't have been away from England
for five years instead of five weeks ... to come back
to a job like this with a fresh mind. D'you know why
really I went back on the Liberals over this question?
Not because they wanted the church money for their pensions ...
but because all they can see in Disestablishment is
destruction. Any fool can destroy! I'm not going to let a
power like the Church get loose from the State. A thirteen
hundred years, tradition of service ... and all they can
think of is to cut it adrift!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I think the Church is moribund.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, yes, of course you do ... you sentimental
agnostic anarchist. Nonsense! The supernatural's a bit
blown upon ... till we re-discover what it means. But
it's not essential. Nor is the Christian doctrine. Put a
Jesuit in a corner and shut the door and he'll own that.
No ... the tradition of self-sacrifice and fellowship in
service for its own sake ... that's the spirit we've to capture
and keep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Really struck.</i>] A secular Church!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With reasoning in his tone.</i>] Well ... why
not? Listen here. In drafting an act of Parliament one
must alternately imagine oneself God Almighty and the
most ignorant prejudiced little blighter who will be
affected by what's passed. God says: Let's have done
with Heaven and Hell ... it's the Earth that shan't pass
away. Why not turn all those theology mongers into
doctors or schoolmasters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. As to doctors&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Quite so, you naturally prejudiced blighter.
That priestcraft don't need re-inforcing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. It needs recognition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. What! It's the only thing most people
believe in. Talk about superstition! However, there's
more life in you. Therefore it's to be schoolmasters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Listen again, young man. In the youth of
the world, when priests were the teachers of men....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Not to be preached at.</i>] And physicians
of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Shut up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. If there's any real reform going, I want
my profession made into a state department. I won't
shut up for less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Putting this aside with one finger.</i>] I'll
deal with you later. There's still Youth in the world in
another sense; but the priests haven't found out the
difference yet, so they're wasting most of their time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Religious education won't do now-a-days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. What's Now-a-days? You're very dull, Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'm not duller than the people who will
have to understand your scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. They won't understand it. I shan't explain
to them that education <i>is</i> religion, and that those who
deal in it are priests without any laying on of hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. No matter what they teach?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No ... the matter is how they teach it. I
see schools in the future, Gilbert, not built next to the
church, but on the site of the church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Do you think the world is grown up
enough to do without dogma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. What!... and am I to write my prescriptions
in English?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes, you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Lord save us! I never thought to find
you a visionary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Isn't it absurd to think that in a hundred
years we shall be giving our best brains and the price of
them not to training grown men into the discipline of destruction
... not even to curing the ills which we might
be preventing ... but to teaching our children. There's
nothing else to be done ... nothing else matters. But
it's work for a priesthood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Affected; not quite convinced.</i>] Do you
think you can buy a tradition and transmute it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Don't mock at money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I never have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. But you speak of it as an end not as a means.
That's unfair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I speaks as I finds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I'll buy the Church, not with money, but
with the promise of new life. [<i>A certain rather gleeful
cunning comes over him.</i>] It'll only look like a dose of
reaction at first ... Sectarian Training Colleges endowed
to the hilt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. What'll the Nonconformists say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Bribe them with the means of equal efficiency.
The crux of the whole matter will be in the
statutes. I'll force on those colleges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. They'll want dogma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Dogma's not a bad thing if you've power to
adapt it occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Instead of spending your brains in
explaining it. Yes, I agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With full voice.</i>] But in the creed I'll
lay down as unalterable there shall be neither Jew nor
Greek.... What do you think of St. Paul, Gilbert?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'd make him the head of a college.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I'll make the Devil himself head of a college,
if he'll undertake to teach honestly all he knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. And he'll conjure up Comte and Robespierre
for you to assist in this little <i>rechauff&eacute;e</i> of their
schemes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Hullo! Comte I knew about. Have I
stolen from Robespierre too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Giving out the epigram with an air.</i>]
Property to him who can make the best use of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. And then what we must do is to give the
children power over their teachers?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Now he is comically enigmatic.</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>
<i>echoes him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. And what exactly do you mean by
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Serious again.</i>] How positive a pedagogue
would you be if you had to prove your cases and justify
your creed every century or so to the pupils who had
learnt just a little more than you could teach them? Give
power to the future, my friend ... not to the past. Give
responsibility ... even if you give it for your own discredit.
What's beneath trust deeds and last wills and
testaments, and even acts of Parliament and official creeds?
Fear of the verdict of the next generation ... fear of
looking foolish in their eyes. Ah, we ... doing our best
now ... must be ready for every sort of death. And to provide
the means of change and disregard of the past is a
secret of statesmanship. Presume that the world will
come to an end every thirty years if it's not reconstructed.
Therefore give responsibility ... give responsibility ... give
the children power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Disposed to whistle.</i>] Those statutes
will want some framing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Relapsing to a chuckle.</i>] There's an incidental
change to foresee. Disappearance of the parson
into the schoolmaster ... and the Archdeacon into
the Inspector ... and the Bishop into&mdash;I rather hope
he'll stick to his mitre, Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Some Ruskin will arise and make him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>As he paces the room and the walls of it fade
away to him.</i>] What a church could be made of the
best brains in England, sworn only to learn all they could
teach what they knew without fear of the future or favour
to the past ... sworn upon their honour as seekers
after truth, knowingly to tell no child a lie. It will
come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. A priesthood of women too? There's
the tradition of service with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With the sourest look yet on his face.</i>]
Slavery ... not quite the same thing. And the paradox
of such slavery is that they're your only tyrants.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>At this moment the bell of the telephone upon the
table rings. He goes to it talking the while.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>One has to be very optimistic not to advocate the harem.
That's simple and wholesome.... Yes?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>comes in.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Does it work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Slamming down the receiver.</i>] You and
your new toy! What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I'm not sure about the plugs of it ... I thought
I'd got them wrong. Mrs. O'Connell has come to see
Miss Trebell, who is out, and she says will we ask you if
any message has been left for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No. Oh, about dinner? Well, she's round
at Mrs. Farrant's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I'll ring them up.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes back into his room to do so leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell's</span>
<i>door open. The two continue their talk.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. My difficulties will be with Percival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Not over the Church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You see I must discover how keen he'd be on
settling the Education quarrel, once and for all ... what
there is left of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. He's not sectarian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It'll cost him his surplus. When'll he be up
and about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Not for a week or more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Knitting his brow.</i>] And I've to deal with
Cantelupe. Curious beggar, Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Not my sort. He'll want some dealing
with over your bill as introduced to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I've not cross-examined company promoters
for ten years without learning how to do business with a
professional high churchman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Providence limited ... eh?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They are interrupted by</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell's</span> <i>appearance
in the doorway. She is rather pale, very
calm; but there is pain in her eyes and her voice is
unnaturally steady.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Your maid told me to come up and I'm interrupting
business.... I thought she was wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With no trace of self-consciousness.</i>] Well ...
how are you, after this long time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. How do you do? [<i>Then she sees</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>
<i>and has to control a shrinking from him.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. How are you, Mrs. O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Kent is telephoning to Frances. He knows
where she is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. How are you, Dr. Wedgecroft? [<i>then to</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>.]
Did you have a good holiday? London pulls one to pieces
wretchedly. I shall give up living here at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You look very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Do I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. A very good holiday. Sit down ... he
won't be a minute.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She sits on the nearest chair.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. You're not ill ... interviewing a doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The one thing Wedgecroft's no good at is
doctoring. He keeps me well by sheer moral suasion.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>comes out of his room and is off downstairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>calls to him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Mrs. O'Connell's here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Oh! [<i>He comes back and into the room.</i>] Miss
Trebell hasn't got there yet.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>has suddenly looked at his watch.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I must fly. Good bye, Mrs. O'Connell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Putting her hand, constrained by its glove, into
his open hand.</i>] I am always a little afraid of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. That isn't the feeling a doctor wants to
inspire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>.] David Evans&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Evans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. The reverend one ... is downstairs and wants
to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>As he comes to them.</i>] Hampstead Road
Tabernacle ... Oh, the mammon of righteousness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Shut up! How long have I before Lord
Charles&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Only ten minutes.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Connell</span> <i>goes to sit at the big table, and
apparently idly takes a sheet of paper to scribble on.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Half thinking, half questioning.</i>] He's a
man I can say nothing to politely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'm off to Percival's now. Then I've
another case and I'm due back at twelve. If there's
anything helpful to say I'll look in again for two minutes ...
not more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You're a good man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>As he goes.</i>] Congratulations, Kent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. [<i>Taking him to the stairs.</i>] Thank you very
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Beckoning with her eyes.</i>] What's this, Mr.
Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Eh? I beg your pardon.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes behind her and reads over her shoulder what
she has written.</i> <span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>comes back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Shall I bring him up here?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>looks up and for a moment stares at his
secretary rather sharply, then speaks in a matter-of-fact
voice.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. See him yourself, downstairs. Talk to him
for five minutes ... find out what he wants. Tell him it
will be as well for the next week or two if he can say he
hasn't seen me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Yes.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>follows him to the door which
he shuts. Then he turns to face</i> <span class="smcap">Amy</span>, <i>who is tearing
up the paper she wrote on.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Her steady voice breaking, her carefully calculated
control giving way.</i>] Oh Henry ... Henry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Are you in trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. You'll hate me, but ... oh, it's brutal of you to
have been away so long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Is it with your husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Perhaps. Oh, come nearer to me ... do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Coming nearer without haste or excitement.</i>]
Well? [<i>Her eyes are closed.</i>] My dear girl, I'm too busy
for love-making now. If there are any facts to be faced,
let me have them ... quite quickly.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She looks up at him for a moment; then speaks
swiftly and sharply as one speaks of disaster.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. There's a danger of my having a child ... your
child ... some time in April. That's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>A sceptic who has seen a vision.</i>] Oh ...
it's impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Flashing at him, revengefully.</i>] Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Brought to his mundane self</i>] Well ...
are you sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>In sudden agony.</i>] D'you think I want it to be
true? D'you think I&mdash;? You don't know what it is to have
a thing happening in spite of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His face set in thought.</i>] Where have you
been since we met?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Not to Ireland ... I haven't seen Justin for a
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. All the easier for you not to see him for another
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. That wasn't what you meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It wasn't ... but never mind.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They are silent for a moment ... miles apart ... Then
she speaks dully.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. We do hate each other ... don't we!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Nonsense. Let's think of what matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Aimlessly.</i>] I went to a man at Dover ...
picked him out of the directory ... didn't give my own
name ... pretended I was off abroad. He was a kind
old thing ... said it was all most satisfactory. Oh, my
God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>He goes to bend over her kindly.</i>] Yes,
you've had a torturing month or two. That's been wrong,
I'm sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Even now I have to keep telling myself that it's
so ... otherwise I couldn't understand it. Any more than
one really believes one will ever die ... one doesn't
believe that, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>On the edge of a sensation that is new to him.</i>]
I am told that a man begins to feel unimportant from this
moment forward. Perhaps it's true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. What has it to do with you anyhow? We don't
belong to each other. How long were we together that
night? Half an hour! You didn't seem to care a bit
until after you'd kissed me and ... this is an absurd
consequence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Nature's a tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Oh, it's my punishment ... I see that well enough ...
for thinking myself so clever ... forgetting my duty and
religion ... not going to confession, I mean. [<i>Then hysterically.</i>]
God can make you believe in Him when he
likes, can't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With comfortable strength.</i>] My dear girl,
this needs your pluck. [<i>And he sits by her.</i>] All we have
to do is to prevent it being found out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Yes ... the scandal would smash you, wouldn't
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. There isn't going to be any scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. No ... if we're careful. You'll tell me what to
do, won't you? Oh, it's a relief to be able to talk
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. For one thing, you must take care of yourself
and stop worrying.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>It soothes her to feel that he is concerned; but it
is not enough to be soothed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Yes, I wouldn't like to have been the means of
smashing you, Henry ... especially as you don't care for
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I intend to care for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Love me, I mean. I wish you did ... a little;
then perhaps I shouldn't feel so degraded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>A shade impatiently, a shade contemptuously</i>]
I can say I love you if that'll make things easier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>More helpless than ever.</i>] If you'd said it at
first I should be taking it for granted ... though it wouldn't
be any more true, I daresay, than now ... when I should
know you weren't telling the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then I'd do without so much confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Don't be so heartless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>As he leaves her.</i>] We seem to be attaching
importance to such different things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Shrill even at a momentary desertion.</i>] What do
you mean? I want affection now just as I want food. I
can't do without it ... I can't reason things out as you
can. D'you think I haven't tried? [<i>Then in sudden
rebellion.</i>] Oh, the physical curse of being a woman ...
no better than any savage in this condition ... worse off
than an animal. It's unfair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Never mind ... you're here now to hand me
half the responsibility, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. As if I could! If I have to lie through the night
simply shaking with bodily fear much longer ... I believe
I shall go mad.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This aspect of the matter is meaningless to him. He
returns to the practical issue.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. There's nobody that need be suspecting, is
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. My maid sees I'm ill and worried and makes
remarks ... only to me so far. Don't I look a wreck? I
nearly ran away when I saw Dr. Wedgecroft ... some of
these men are so clever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Calculating.</i>] Someone will have to be
trusted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Burrowing into her little tortured self again.</i>]
And I ought to feel as if I had done Justin a great wrong ...
but I don't. I hate you now; now and then. I was
being myself. You've brought me down. I feel worthless.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The last word strikes him. He stares at her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Pleadingly.</i>] There's only one thing I'd like
you to tell me, Henry ... it isn't much. That night we
were together ... it was for a moment different to everything
that has ever been in your life before, wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Collecting himself as if to explain to a child.</i>]
I must make you understand ... I must get you to realise
that for a little time to come you're above the law ... above
even the shortcomings and contradictions of a man's
affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. But let us have one beautiful memory to share.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Determined she shall face the cold logic of her
position.</i>] Listen. I look back on that night as one looks
back on a fit of drunkenness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Neither understanding nor wishing to; only
shocked and hurt.</i>] You beast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With bitter sarcasm.</i>] No, don't say that.
Won't it comfort you to think of drunkenness as a beautiful
thing? There are precedents enough ... classic ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. You mean I might have been any other woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Quite inexorable.</i>] Wouldn't any other
woman have served the purpose ... and is it less of a
purpose because we didn't know we had it? Does my
unworthiness then ... if you like to call it so ... make you
unworthy now? I must make you see that it doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Petulantly hammering at her id&eacute;e fixe.</i>] But you
didn't love me ... and you don't love me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Keeping his patience.</i>] No ... only within
the last five minutes have I really taken the smallest
interest in you. And now I believe I'm half jealous. Can
you understand that? You've been talking a lot of nonsense
about your emotions and your immortal soul. Don't
you see it's only now that you've become a person of some
importance to the world ... and why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Losing her patience, childishly.</i>] What do you
mean by the World? You don't seem to have any personal
feelings at all. It's horrible you should have thought of me
like that. There has been no other man than you that I
would have let come anywhere near me ... not for more
than a year.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He realises that she will never understand.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. My dear girl, I'm sorry to be brutal. Does
it matter so much to you that I should have wished to
be the father of your child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Ungracious but pacified by his change of tone.</i>]
It doesn't matter now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Friendly still.</i>] On principle I don't make
promises. But I think I can promise you that if you
keep your head and will keep your health, this shall all be
made as easy for you as if everyone could know. And
let's think what the child may mean to you ... just the
fact of his birth. Nothing to me, of course! Perhaps
that accounts for the touch of jealousy. I've forfeited my
rights because I hadn't honourable intentions. You
can't forfeit yours. Even if you never see him and he has
to grow up among strangers ... just to have had a child
must make a difference to you. Of course, it may be a
girl. I wonder.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As he wanders on so optimistically she stares at him
and her face changes. She realises....</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Do you expect me to go through with this?
Henry! ... I'd sooner kill myself.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is silence between them. He looks at her as
one looks at some unnatural thing. Then after a
moment he speaks, very coldly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh ... indeed. Don't get foolish ideas
into your head. You've no choice now ... no reasonable
choice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Driven to bay; her last friend an enemy.</i>] I
won't go through with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It hasn't been so much the fear of scandal
then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. That wouldn't break my heart. You'd marry me,
wouldn't you? We could go away somewhere. I could be
very fond of you, Henry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Marvelling at these tangents.</i>] Marry you!
I should murder you in a week.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This sounds only brutal to her; she lets herself be
shamed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. You've no more use for me than the use you've
made of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Logical again.</i>] Won't you realise that
there's a third party to our discussion ... that I'm of no
importance beside him and you of very little. Think of
the child.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Amy</span> <i>blazes into desperate rebellion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. There's no child because I haven't chosen there
shall be and there shan't be because I don't choose. You'd
have me first your plaything and then Nature's, would you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>A little abashed.</i>] Come now, you knew
what you were about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Thinking of those moments.</i>] Did I? I found
myself wanting you, belonging to you suddenly. I
didn't stop to think and explain. But are we never to be
happy and irresponsible ... never for a moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well ... one can't pick and choose consequences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Your choices in life have made you what you
want to be, haven't they? Leave me mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. But it's too late to argue like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. If it is, I'd better jump into the Thames. I've
thought of it.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He considers how best to make a last effort to bring
her to her senses. He sits by her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Amy ... if you were my wife&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Unresponsive to him now.</i>] I was Justin's
wife, and I went away from him sooner than bear him
children. Had I the right to choose or had I not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Taking another path.</i>] Shall I tell you
something I believe? If we were left to choose, we should
stand for ever deciding whether to start with the right foot
or the left. We blunder into the best things in life.
Then comes the test ... have we faith enough to go on ... to
go through with the unknown thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>So bored by these metaphysics.</i>] Faith in what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Our vitality. I don't give a fig for beauty,
happiness, or brains. All I ask of myself is ... can I pay
Fate on demand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Yes ... in imagination. But I've got physical
facts to face.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>But he has her attention now and pursues the advantage.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Very well then ... let the meaning of them
go. Look forward simply to a troublesome illness. In a
little while you can go abroad quietly and wait patiently.
We're not fools and we needn't find fools to trust in. Then
come back to England....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. And forget. That seems simple enough, doesn't
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. If you don't want the child let it be mine ...
not yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Wondering suddenly at this bond between them.</i>]
Yours! What would you do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Matter-of-fact.</i>] Provide for it, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Never see it, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Perhaps not. If there were anything to be
gained ... for the child. I'll see that he has his chance as
a human being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. How hopeful! [<i>Now her voice drops. She is
looking back, perhaps at a past self.</i>] If you loved me ...
perhaps I might learn to love the thought of your child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>As if half his life depended on her answer.</i>]
Is that true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Irritably.</i>] Why are you picking me to pieces?
I think that is true. If you had been loving me for a long,
long time&mdash;[<i>The agony rushes back on her.</i>] But now
I'm only afraid. You might have some pity for me ... I'm
so afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Touched.</i>] Indeed ... indeed, I'll take
what share of this I can.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She shrinks from him unforgivingly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. No, let me alone. I'm nothing to you. I'm a
sick beast in danger of my life, that's all ... cancerous!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is roused for the first time, roused to horror and
protest.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, you unhappy woman! ... if life is
like death to you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. [<i>Turning on him.</i>] Don't lecture me! If you're
so clever put a stop to this horror. Or you might at least
say you're sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Sorry! [<i>The bell on the table rings jarringly.</i>]
Cantelupe!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes to the telephone. She gets up cold and
collected, steadied merely by the unexpected sound.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. I mustn't keep you from governing the country.
I'm sure you'll do it very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>At the telephone.</i>] Yes, bring him up, of
course ... isn't Mr. Kent there? [<i>then to her.</i>] I may be
ten minutes with him or half an hour. Wait and we'll
come to a conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>comes in, an open letter in his hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. This note, sir. Had I better go round myself
and see him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>As he takes the note.</i>] Cantelupe's come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. [<i>Glancing at the telephone.</i>] Oh, has he!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>As he reads.</i>] Yes I think you had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Evans was very serious.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes back into his room.</i> <span class="smcap">Amy</span> <i>moves swiftly to
where</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>is standing and whispers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Won't you tell me whom to go to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Oh, really ... what unpractical sentimental children
you men are! You and your consciences ... you and
your laws. You drive us to distraction and sometimes to
death by your stupidities. Poor women&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Glad to see you. You know Mrs O'Connell.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>bows in silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. We have met.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She offers her hand. He silently takes it and drops it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then you'll wait for Frances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Is it worth while?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>with his hat on leaves his room and goes
downstairs.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Have you anything better to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. There's somewhere I can go. But I mustn't
keep you chatting of my affairs. Lord Charles is impatient
to disestablish the Church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Unable to escape a remark.</i>] Forgive me,
since that is also your affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Oh ... but I was received at the Oratory when I
was married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With contrition.</i>] I beg your pardon.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Then he makes for the other side of the room</i>, <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. I think I'll go on to this place that I've heard
of. If I wait ... for your sister ... she may disappoint me
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Wait.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Kent's</span> <i>room is vacant.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Well ... in here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. If you like law-books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. I haven't been much of an interruption now,
have I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Please wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amy</span>. Thank you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>shuts her in, for a moment seems inclined to

himself on his subject like a gun, fires off a speech,
without haste, but also apparently without taking
breath.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I was extremely thankful, Mr. Trebell,
to hear last week from Horsham that you will see your
way to join his cabinet and undertake the disestablishment
bill in the House of Commons. Any measure of
mine, I have always been convinced, would be too much
under the suspicion of blindly favouring Church interests
to command the allegiance of that heterogeneous mass of
thought ... in some cases, alas, of free thought ... which
now-a-days composes the Conservative party. I am
more than content to exercise what influence I may from
a seat in the cabinet which will authorise the bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes. That chair's comfortable.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>takes another.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Horsham forwarded to me your memorandum
upon the conditions you held necessary and I
incline to think I may accept them in principle on behalf of
those who honour me with their confidences.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He fishes some papers from his pocket.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>
<i>sits squarely at his table to grapple with the
matter.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Horsham told me you did accept them ...
it's on that I'm joining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Yes ... in principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well ... we couldn't carry a bill you disapproved
of, could we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With finesse.</i>] I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>A little dangerously.</i>] And I have no
intention of being made the scapegoat of a wrecked Tory
compromise with the Nonconformists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Calmly ignoring the suggestion.</i>] So far
as I am concerned I meet the Nonconformists on their own
ground ... that Religion had better be free from all
compromise with the State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Quite so ... if you're set free you'll look
after yourselves. My discovery must be what to do with
the men who think more of the state than their Church ...
the majority of parsons, don't you think? ... if the
question's really put and they can be made to understand
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With sincere disdain.</i>] There are more
profitable professions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. And less. Will you allow me that it is
statecraft to make a profession profitable?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>picks up his papers, avoiding theoretical
discussion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Well now ... will you explain to me
this project for endowing Education with your surplus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Putting Appropriation, the Buildings and
the Representation question on one side for the moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Candidly, I have yet to master your
figures....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The roughest figures so far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Still I have yet to master them on the
first two points.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Firmly premising.</i>] We agree that this
is not diverting church money to actually secular uses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>As he peeps from under his eyelids.</i>] I can
conceive that it might not be. You know that we hold
Education to be a Church function. But....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Can you accept thoroughly now the secular
solution for all Primary Schools?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Haven't we always preferred it to the
undenominational? Are there to be facilities for <i>any</i> of
the teachers giving dogmatic instruction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I note your emphasis on any. I think we
can put the burden of that decision on local authorities.
Let us come to the question of Training Colleges for your
teachers. It's on that I want to make my bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Alert and cautious.</i>] You want to endow
colleges?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Heavily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Under public control?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Church colleges under Church control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. There'd be others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. To preserve the necessary balance in the
schools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Not founded with church money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Think of the grants in aid that will be released.
I must ask the Treasury for a further lump sum
and with that there may be sufficient for secular colleges ...
if you can agree with me upon the statutes of those over
which you'd otherwise have free control.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>is weighing his words.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. "You" meaning, for instance ... what
authorities in the Church?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Bishops, I suppose ... and others, [<span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>
<i>permits himself to smile.</i>] On that point I shall
be weakness itself and ... may I suggest ... your seat in
the cabinet will give you some control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Statutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. To be framed in the best interests of educational
efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Finding an opening.</i>] I doubt if we agree
upon the meaning to be attached to that term.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Forcing the issue.</i>] What meaning do you
attach to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Smiling again.</i>] I have hardly a sympathetic
listener.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You have an unprejudiced one ... the
best you can hope for. I was not educated myself. I
learnt certain things that I desired to know ... from
reading my first book&mdash;Don Quixote it was&mdash;to mastering
Company Law. You see, as a man without formulas
either for education or religion, I am perhaps peculiarly
fitted to settle the double question. I have no grudges ...
no revenge to take.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Suddenly congenial.</i>] Shelton's translation
of Don Quixote I hope ... the modern ones have no
flavour. And you took all the adventures as seriously as
the Don did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Not expecting this.</i>] I forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. It's the finer attitude ... the child's
attitude. And it would enable you immediately to comprehend
mine towards an education consisting merely of
practical knowledge. The life of Faith is still the happy
one. What is more crushingly finite than knowledge?
Moral discipline is a nation's only safety. How much of
your science tends in support of the great spiritual doctrine
of sacrifice!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>returns to his subject as forceful as ever.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The Church has assimilated much in her
time. Do you think it wise to leave agnostic science at the
side of the plate? I think, you know, that this craving for
common knowledge is a new birth in the mind of man;
and if your church won't recognise that soon, by so much
will she be losing her grip for ever over men's minds.
What's the test of godliness, but your power to receive
the new idea in whatever form it comes and give it life?
It is blasphemy to pick and choose your good. [<i>For a
moment his thoughts seem to be elsewhere.</i>] That's an unhappy
man or woman or nation ... I know it if it has
only come to me this minute ... and I don't care what
their brains or their riches or their beauty or any of
their triumph may be ... they're unhappy and useless if
they can't tell life from death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Interested in the digression</i>] Remember
that the Church's claim has ever been to know that
difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Fastening to his subject again.</i>] My
point is this: A man's demand to know the exact structure
of a fly's wing, and his assertion that it degrades any child
in the street not to know such a thing, is a religious
revival ... a token of spiritual hunger. What else can it
be? And we commercialise our teaching!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I wouldn't have it so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then I'm offering you the foundation of a
new Order of men and women who'll serve God by teaching
his children. Now shall we finish the conversation in
prose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Not to be put down.</i>] What is the prose
for God?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Not to be put down either.</i>] That's what we
irreligious people are giving our lives to discover. [<i>He
plunges into detail.</i>] I'm proposing to found about
seventy-two new colleges, and of course, to bring the ones
there are up to the new standard. Then we must gradually
revise all teaching salaries in government schools ...
to a scale I have in mind. Then the course must be
compulsory and the training time doubled&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Doubled! Four years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well, a minimum of three ... a university
course. Remember we're turning a trade into a calling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. There's more to that than taking a degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I think so. You've fought for years for
your tests and your atmosphere with plain business men
not able to understand such lunacy. Quite right ...
atmosphere's all that matters. If one and one don't make
two by God's grace....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Poetry again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I beg your pardon. Well ... you've no
further proof. If you can't plant your thumb on the earth
and your little finger on the pole star you know nothing of
distances. We must do away with text-book teachers.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>is opening out a little in spite of himself.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I'm waiting for our opinions to differ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Businesslike again.</i>] I'll send you a draft
of the statutes I propose within a week. Meanwhile shall
I put the offer this way. If I accept your tests will you
accept mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. What are yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I believe if one provides for efficiency one
provides for the best part of truth ... honesty of statement.
I shall hope for a little more elasticity in your dogmas than
Becket or Cranmer or Laud would have allowed. When
you've a chance to re-formulate the reasons of your faith
for the benefit of men teaching mathematics and science
and history and political economy, you won't neglect to
answer or allow for criticisms and doubts. I don't see
why ... in spite of all the evidence to the contrary ... such a
thing as progress in a definite religious faith is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Progress is a soiled word. [<i>And now he
weighs his words.</i>] I shall be very glad to accept on the
Church's behalf control of the teaching of teachers in these
colleges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Good. I want the best men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. You are surprisingly inexperienced if you
think that creeds can ever become mere forms except to
those who have none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. But teaching&mdash;true teaching&mdash;is learning, and
the wish to know is going to prevail against any creed ...
so I think. I wish you cared as little for the form in which
a truth is told as I do. On the whole, you see, I think I
shall manage to plant your theology in such soil this
spring that the garden will be fruitful. On the whole
I'm a believer in Churches of all sorts and their usefulness
to the State. Your present use is out-worn. Have
I found you in this the beginnings of a new one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. The Church says: Thank you, it is a
very old one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Winding up the interview.</i>] To be sure, for
practical politics our talk can be whittled down to your
accepting the secular solution for Primary Schools, if
you're given these colleges under such statutes as you and I
shall agree upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. And the country will accept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The country will accept any measure if
there's enough money in it to bribe all parties fairly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. You expect very little of the constancy of
my Church to her Faith, Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I have only one belief myself. That is in
human progress&mdash;yes, progress&mdash;over many obstacles and
by many means. I have no ideals. I believe it is statesmanlike
to use all the energy you find ... turning it into
the nearest channel that points forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Forward to what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I don't know ... and my caring doesn't
matter. We do know ... and if we deny it it's only to be
encouraged by contradiction ... that the movement is
forward and with some gathering purpose. I'm friends
with any fellow traveller.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>has been considering him very curiously.
Now he gets up to go.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I should like to continue our talk when I've
studied your draft of the statutes. Of course the political
position is favourable to a far more comprehensive bill
than we had ever looked for ... and you've the advantage
now of having held yourself very free from party ties.
In fact not only will you give us the bill we shall most
care to accept, but I don't know what other man would
give us a bill we and the other side could accept
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I can let you have more Appropriation
figures by Friday. The details of the Fabrics scheme will
take a little longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. In a way there's no such hurry. We're
not in office yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. When I'm building with figures I like to
give the foundations time to settle. Otherwise they are
the inexactest things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Smiling to him for the first time.</i>] We
shall have you finding Faith the only solvent of all problems
some day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I hope my mind is not afraid ... even of
the Christian religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I am sure that the needs of the human
soul ... be it dressed up in whatever knowledge ... do not
alter from age to age....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He opens the door to find</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>standing
outside, watch in hand.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Hullo ... waiting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I was giving you two minutes by my
watch. How are you, Cantelupe?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>, <i>with a gesture which might be mistaken
for a bow, folds himself up.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Shall I bring you the figures on Friday ...
that might save time.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>, <i>by taking a deeper fold in himself seems
to assent.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Will the afternoon do? Kent shall fix the hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With an effort.</i>] Kent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. My secretary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Friday. Any hour before five. I know
my way.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The three phrases having meant three separate
efforts,</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>escapes.</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>has
walked to the table, his brows a little puckered. Now</i>
<span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>notices that</i> <span class="smcap">Kent's</span> <i>door is open; he goes
quickly into the room and finds it empty. Then he
stands for a moment irritable and undecided before
returning.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Been here long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Five minutes ... more, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Mrs. O'Connell gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. To her dressmaker's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Frances forgot she was coming and went out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Pretty little fool of a woman! D'you
know her husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Says she's been in Ireland with him
since we met at Shapters. He has trouble with his
tenantry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Won't he sell or won't they purchase?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Curious chap. A Don at Balliol when
I first knew him. Warped of late years ... perhaps by
his marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Dismissing that subject.</i>] Well ... how's
Percival?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Better this morning. I told him I'd
seen you ... and in a little calculated burst of confidence
what I'd reason to think you were after. He said you and
he could get on though you differed on every point; but
he didn't see how you'd pull with such a blasted weak-kneed
lot as the rest of the Horsham's cabinet would be.
He'll be up in a week or ten days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Can I see him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You might. I admire the old man ...
the way he sticks to his party, though they misrepresent
now most things he believes in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. What a damnable state to arrive at ...
doubly damned by the fact you admire it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. And to think that at this time of day
you should need instructing in the ethics of party government.
But I'll have to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Not now. I've been at ethics with Cantelupe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Certainly not now. What about my
man with the stomach-ache at twelve o'clock sharp!
Good-bye.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is gone,</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>battles with uneasiness and
at last mutters.</i> "Oh ... why didn't she wait?"
<i>Then the telephone bell rings. He goes quickly as if
it were an answer to his anxiety.</i> "Yes?" <i>Of
course, it isn't..</i> "Yes." <i>He paces the room, impatient,
wondering what to do. The Maid comes in
to announce</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Davenport</span>. <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>follows her.
She has gained lately perhaps a little of the joy
which was lacking and at least she brings now into
this room a breath of very wholesome womanhood.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. It's very good of you to let me come; I'm not
going to keep you more than three minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Sit down.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Only women unused to busy men would call him
rude.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. What I want to say is ... don't mind my being
engaged to Walter. It shan't interfere with his work for
you. If you want a proof that it shan't ... it was I got
Aunt Julia to ask you to take him.... Though he didn't
know ... so don't tell him that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You weren't engaged then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. I ... thought that we might be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With cynical humour.</i>] Which I'm not to
tell him either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Oh, that wouldn't matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With decision.</i>] I'll make sure you don't
interfere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. [<i>Deliberately ... not to be treated as a child.</i>]
You couldn't, you know, if I wanted to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Why, is Walter a fool?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. He's very fond of me, if that's what you mean?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>looks at her for the first time and changes
his tone a little.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. If it was what I meant ... I'm disposed to
withdraw the suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. And, because I'm fond of his work as well, I
shan't therefore ask him to tell me things ... secrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Reverting to his humour.</i>] It'll be when
you're a year or two married that danger may occur ... in
his desperate effort to make conversation.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>considers this and him quite seriously.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. You're rather hard on women, aren't you ...
just because they don't have the chances men do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Do you want the chances?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. I think I'm as clever as most men I meet, though
I know less, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Perhaps I should have offered you the
secretaryship instead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. [<i>Readily.</i>] Don't you think I'm taking it in a
way ... by marrying Walter? That's fanciful of course.
But marriage is a very general and complete sort of
partnership, isn't it? At least, I'd like to make
mine so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. He'll be more under your thumb in some
things if you leave him free in others.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She receives the sarcasm in all seriousness and then
speaks to him as she would to a child.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Oh ... I'm not explaining what I mean quite
well perhaps. Walter has been everywhere and done
everything. He speaks three languages ... which all
makes him an ideal private secretary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Do you think he'd develop into anything else ...
but for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. So I have provided just a first step, have I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. [<i>With real enthusiasm.</i>] Oh, Mr. Trebell, it's a
great thing for us. There isn't anyone worth working
under but you. You'll make him think and give him ideas
instead of expecting them from him. But just for that
reason he'd get so attached to you and be quite content
to grow old in your shadow ... if it wasn't for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. True ... I should encourage him in nothingness.
What's more, I want extra brains and hands. It's
not altogether a pleasant thing, is it ... the selfishness of
the hard worked man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. If you don't grudge your own strength, why
should you be tender of other people's?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He looks at her curiously.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Your ambition is making for only second-hand
satisfaction though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. What's a woman to do? She must work through
men, mustn't she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I'm told that's degrading ... the influencing
of husbands and brothers and sons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. [<i>Only half humorously.</i>] But what else is one
to do with them? Of course, I've enough money to live
on ... so I could take up some woman's profession ...
What are you smiling at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Who has smiled very broadly.</i>] As you
don't mean to ... don't stop while I tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. But I'd sooner get married. I want to have
children. [<i>The words catch him and hold him. He looks
at her reverently this time. She remembers she has transgressed
convention; then, remembering that it is only convention,
proceeds quite simply.</i>] I hope we shall have
children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Thank you. That's the first kind thing you've
said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh ... you can do without compliments,
can't you?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She considers for a moment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Why have you been talking to me as if I were
someone else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Startled.</i>] Who else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. No one particular. But you've shaken a moral
fist so to speak. I don't think I provoked it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It's a bad parliamentary habit. I apologise.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She gets up to go.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Now I shan't keep you longer ... you're always
busy. You've been so easy to talk to. Thank you very
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Why ... I wonder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. I knew you would be or I shouldn't have come.
You think Life's an important thing, don't you? That's
priggish, isn't it? Good-bye. We're coming to dinner ...
Aunt Julia and I. Miss Trebell arrived to ask us just as I
left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I'll see you down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. What waste of time for you. I know how the
door opens.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As she goes out</i> <span class="smcap">Walter Kent</span> <i>is on the way to his
room. The two nod to each other like old friends.</i>
<span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>turns away with something of a sigh.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Just come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Just going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I'll see you at dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>. Oh, are you to be here? ... that's nice.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span> <i>departs as purposefully as she came.</i> <span class="smcap">Kent</span>
<i>hurries to</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>, <i>whose thoughts are away again
by now.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I haven't been long there and back, have I?
The Bishop gave me these letters for you. He hasn't
answered the last ... but I've his notes of what he means
to say. He'd like them back to-night. He was just
going out. I've one or two notes of what Evans said.
Bit of a charlatan, don't you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Evans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Well, he talked of his Flock. There are quite
fifteen letters you'll have to deal with yourself, I'm afraid.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>stares at him: then, apparently, making
up his mind....</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Ring up a messenger, will you ... I must
write a note and send it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Will you dictate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I shall have done it while you're ringing ...
it's only a personal matter. Then we'll start work.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>goes into his room and tackles the telephone
there.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>sits down to write the note, his
face very set and anxious.</i></p></blockquote>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE THIRD ACT</h2>


<p>At <span class="smcap">Lord Horsham's</span> house in Queen Anne's Gate, in the
evening, a week later.</p>

<p><i>If rooms express their owners' character, the grey and black
of</i><span class="smcap"> Lord Horsham's</span> <i>drawing room, the faded brocade
of its furniture, reveal him as a man of delicate taste
and somewhat thin intellectuality. He stands now
before a noiseless fire, contemplating with a troubled
eye either the pattern of the Old French carpet, or the
black double doors of the library opposite, or the
moulding on the Adams ceiling, which the flicker of
all the candles casts into deeper relief. His grey hair
and black clothes would melt into the decoration of his
room, were the figure not rescued from such oblivion
by the British white glaze of his shirt front and&mdash;to a
sympathetic eye&mdash;by the loveable perceptive face of the
man. Sometimes he looks at the sofa in front of him,
on which sits</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>, <i>still in the frock coat
of a busy day, depressed and irritable. With his
back to them, on a sofa with its back to them, is
</i> <span class="smcap">George Farrant</span>, <i>planted with his knees apart, his
hands clasped, his head bent; very glum. And
sometimes</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>glances at the door, as if waiting
for it to open. Then his gaze will travel back, up
the long shiny black piano, with a volume of the
Well Tempered Clavichord open on its desk, to where
</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>is perched uncomfortably on the bench;
paler than ever; more self-contained than ever, looking,
to one who knows him as well as Horsham does, a
little dangerous. So he returns to contemplation of
the ceiling or the carpet. They wait there as men
wait who have said all they want to say upon an
unpleasant subject and yet cannot dismiss it. At
last</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>breaks the silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. What time did you ask him to come,
Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Eh ... O'Connell? I didn't ask him directly.
What time did you say, Wedgecroft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Any time after half past ten, I told him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Grumbling.</i>] It's a quarter to eleven.
Doesn't Blackborough mean to turn up at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. He was out of town ... my note had to be
sent after him. I couldn't wire, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. It was by the merest chance your man
caught me, Cyril. I was taking the ten fifteen to Tonbridge
and happened to go to James Street first for some
papers.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The conversation flags again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. But since Mrs. O'Connell is dead what
is the excuse for a scandal?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this unpleasant dig into the subject of their
thoughts the three other men stir uncomfortably.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Because the inquest is unavoidable ... apparently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Suddenly letting fly.</i>] I declare I'd
I'd have risked penal servitude and given a certificate, but
just before the end O'Connell would call in old Fielding
Andrews, who has moral scruples about everything&mdash;it's
his trademark&mdash;and of course about this...!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Was he told of the whole business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. No ... O'Connell kept things up before
him. Well ... the woman was dying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Couldn't you have kept the true state of the
case from Sir Fielding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. And been suspected of the malpractice
myself if he'd found it out? ... which he would have done
... he's no fool. Well ... I thought of trying that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. My dear Wedgecroft ... how grossly quixotic!
You have a duty to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Rescuing the conversation from unpleasantness.</i>]
I'm afraid I feel that our position to-night is most
irregular, Wedgecroft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Still if you can make O'Connell see
reason. And if you all can't.... [<i>He frowns at the alternative.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Didn't you say she came to you first of all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I met her one morning at Trebell's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Actually <i>at</i> Trebell's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. The day he came back from abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Oh! No one seems to have noticed them
together much at any time. My wife ... No matter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. She tackled me as a doctor with one
part of her trouble ... added she'd been with O'Connell
in Ireland, which of course it turns out wasn't true ...
asked me to help her. I had to say I couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Echoing rather than querying.</i>] You
couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Shocked.</i>] My dear Horsham!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Well, if she'd told me the truth!... No,
anyhow I couldn't. I'm sure there was no excuse. One
can't run these risks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Quite right, quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. There are men who do on one pretext
or another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Not too shocked to be curious.</i>] Are there
really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Oh yes, men well known ... in other
directions. I could give you four addresses ... but of
course I wasn't going to give her one. Though there
again ... if she'd told me the whole truth!... My God,
women are such fools! And they prefer quackery ... look
at the decent doctors they simply turn into charlatans.
Though, there again, that all comes of letting a trade work
mysteriously under the thumb of a benighted oligarchy ...
which is beside the question. But one day I'll make you
sit up on the subject of the Medical Council, Horsham.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>assumes an impenetrable air of statesmanship.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I know. Very interesting ... very important
... very difficult to alter the status quo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Then the poor little liar said she'd go off
to an appointment with her dressmaker; and I heard
nothing more till she sent for me a week later, and I found
her almost too ill to speak. Even then she didn't tell me
the truth! So, when O'Connell arrived, of course I spoke
to him quite openly and all he told me in reply was that it
wouldn't have been his child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Poor devil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I wonder. Perhaps she didn't realize
he'd been sent for ... or felt then she was dying and
didn't care ... or lost her head. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Such a pretty little woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. If I could have made him out and
dealt with him, of course, I shouldn't have come to you.
Farrant's known him even longer than I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. I was with him at Harrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. So I went to Farrant first.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>That part of the subject drops.</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>, <i>who
has not moved, strikes in again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. How was Trebell's guilt discovered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. He wrote her one letter which she didn't
destroy. O'Connell found it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Picked it up from her desk ... it
wasn't even locked up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Not twenty words in it ... quite enough
though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. His habit of being explicit ... of writing
things down ... I know!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He shakes his head, deprecating all rashness. There
is another pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>, <i>getting up to pace about,
breaks it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Look here, Wedgecroft, one thing is worrying
me. Had Trebell any foreknowledge of what she did and
the risk she was running and could he have stopped it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Almost ill-temperedly.</i>] How could he
have stopped it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Because ... well, I'm not a casuist ... but
I know by instinct when I'm up against the wrong thing
to do; and if he can't be cleared on that point I won't lift a
finger to save him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>With nice judgment.</i>] In using the term
Any Foreknowledge, Farrant, you may be more severe
on him than you wish to be.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>, <i>unappreciative, continues.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Otherwise ... well, we must admit, Cantelupe,
that if it hadn't been for the particular consequence
of this it wouldn't be anything to be so mightily shocked
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I disagree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. My dear fellow, it's our business to make
laws and we know the difference of saying in one of 'em
you may or you must. Who ever proposed to insist on
pillorying every case of spasmodic adultery? One would
never have done! Some of these attachments do more
harm ... to the third party, I mean ... some less. But it's
only when a menage becomes socially impossible that a
sensible man will interfere. [<i>He adds quite unnecessarily.</i>]
I'm speaking quite impersonally, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>As coldly as ever.</i>] Trebell is morally
responsible for every consequence of the original sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. That is a hard saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Continuing his own remarks quite independently.</i>]
And I put aside the possibility that he deliberately
helped her to her death to save a scandal because I don't
believe it is a possibility. But if that were so I'd lift my
finger to help him to his. I'd see him hanged with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Settling this part of the matter.</i>] Well,
Farrant, to all intents and purposes he didn't know and
he'd have stopped it if he could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Yes, I believe that. But what makes you
so sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I asked him and he told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. That's no proof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You read the letter that he sent her ...
unless you think it was written as a blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Oh ... to be sure ... yes. I might have
thought of that.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He settles down again. Again no one has anything
to say.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. What is to be said to Mr. O'Connell
when he comes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Yes ... what exactly do you propose we
shall say to O'Connell, Wedgecroft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Get him to open his oyster of a mind
and....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. So it is and his face like a stone wall yesterday.
Absolutely refused to discuss the matter with me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. May I ask, Cyril, why are we concerning
ourselves with this wickedness at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Just at this moment when we have official
weight without official responsibility, Charles....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I wish I could have let Percival out of
bed, but these first touches of autumn are dangerous to a
convalescent of his age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. But you saw him, Farrant ... and he
gave you his opinion, didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Last night ... yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I suppose it's a pity Blackborough hasn't
turned up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Never mind him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. He gets people to agree with him. That's a
gift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Wedgecroft, what is the utmost O'Connell
will be called upon to do for us ... for Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Probably only to hold his tongue at the
inquest to-morrow. As far as I know there's no one but
her maid to prove that Mrs. O'Connell didn't meet her
husband some time in the summer. He'll be called upon
to tell a lie or two by implication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Cantelupe ... what does perjury to that
extent mean to a Roman Catholic?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe's</span> <i>face melts into an expression of mild
amazement.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Your asking such a question shows that
you would not understand my answer to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Leaving the fellow to his subtleties.</i>] Well,
what about the maid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. She may suspect facts but not names, I
think. Why should they question her on such a point if
O'Connell says nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. He's really very late. I told ... [<i>He stops.</i>]
Charles, I've forgotten that man's name again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Edmunds, you said it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Edmunds. Everybody's down at Lympne ...
I've been left with a new man here and I don't know his
name. [<i>He is very pathetic.</i>] I told him to put O'Connell
in the library there. I thought that either Farrant or I
might perhaps see him first and&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this moment</i> <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span> <i>comes in, and, with that
air of discreet tact which he considers befits the establishment
of a Prime Minister, announces</i>, "Mr.
O'Connell, my lord." <i>As</i> <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>follows him</i>,
<span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>can only try not to look too disconcerted.</i>
<span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>, <i>in his tightly buttoned frock coat, with
his shaven face and close-cropped iron grey hair,
might be mistaken for a Catholic priest; except that
he has not also acquired the easy cheerfulness which
professional familiarity with the mysteries of that
religion seems to give. For the moment, at least, his
features are so impassive that they may tell either
of the deepest grief or the purest indifference; or it
may be, merely of reticence on entering a stranger's
room. He only bows towards</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham's</span> <i>half-proffered
hand. With instinctive respect for the
situation of this tragically made widower the men
have risen and stand in various uneasy attitudes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Oh ... how do you do? Let me see ... do
you know my cousin Charles Cantelupe? Yes ... we were
expecting Russell Blackborough. Sir Henry Percival is
ill. Do sit down.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>takes the nearest chair and gradually
the others settle themselves</i>; <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>seeking an
obscure corner. But there follows an uncomfortable
silence, which</i> <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>at last breaks.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. You have sent for me, Lord Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I hope that by my message I conveyed no
impression of sending for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I am always in some doubt as to by what
person or persons in or out of power this country is
governed. But from all I hear you are at the present
moment approximately entitled to send for me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The level music of his Irish tongue seems to give
finer edge to his sarcasm.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Well, Mr. O'Connell ... you know our
request before we make it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. Yes, I understand that if the fact of Mr.
Trebell's adultery with my wife were made as public as its
consequences to her must be to-morrow, public opinion
would make it difficult for you to include him in your
cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Therefore we ask you ... though we have no
right to ask you ... to consider the particular circumstances
and forget the man in the statesman, Mr. O'Connell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. My wife is dead. What have I to do at all
with Mr. Trebell as a man? As a statesman I am in any
case uninterested in him.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Upon this throwing of cold water</i>, <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span> <i>returns
to mention even more discreetly....</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>. Mr. Blackborough is in the library, my
lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Patiently impatient.</i>] No, no ... here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Let me go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>To the injured</i> <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>.] Wait ... wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'll put him <i>au fait.</i> I shan't come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Gratefully.</i>] Yes, yes. [<i>Then to</i> <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>
<i>who is waiting with perfect dignity.</i>] Yes ... yes ... yes.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Edmunds</span> <i>departs and</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>makes for the
library door, glad to escape.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. If you are not busy at this hour, Wedgecroft,
I should be grateful if you'd wait for me. I shall
keep you, I think, but a very few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>In his most matter-of-fact tone.</i>] All
right, O'Connell.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes into the library.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Don't you think, Cyril, it would be wiser
to prevent your man coming into the room at all while we're
discussing this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Collecting his scattered tact.</i>] Yes, I thought
I had arranged that he shouldn't. I'm very sorry. He's
a fool. However, there's no one else to come. Once
more, Mr. O'Connell.... [<i>He frames no sentence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I am all attention, Lord Horsham.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>with a self-denying effort has risen to his
feet.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Mr. O'Connell I remain here almost
against my will. I cannot think quite calmly about this
double and doubly heinous sin. Don't listen to us while
we make light of it. If we think of it as a political bother
and ask you to smooth it away ... I am ashamed. But I
believe I may not be wrong if I put it to you that, looking
to the future and for the sake of your own Christian dignity,
it may become you to be merciful. And I pray too ... I
think we may believe ... that Mr. Trebell is feeling need of
your forgiveness. I have no more to say. [<i>He sits down
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. It may be. I have never met Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I tell you, Mr. O'Connell, putting aside
Party, that your country has need of this man just at this
time.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They hang upon</i> <span class="smcap">O'Connell's</span> <i>reply. It comes with
deliberation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I suppose my point of view must be an
unusual one. I notice, at least, that twenty four hours
and more has not enabled Farrant to grasp it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. For God's sake, O'Connell, don't be so
cold-blooded. You have the life or death of a man's
reputation to decide on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. [<i>With a cold flash of contempt.</i>] That's a
petty enough thing now-a-days it seems to me. There are
so many clever men ... and they are all so alike ... surely
one will not be missed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Don't you think that is only sarcasm, Mr.
O'Connell?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The voice is so gently reproving that</i> <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>
<i>must turn to him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. Will you please to make allowance, Lord
Charles, for a mediaeval scholar's contempt of modern
government? You at least will partly understand his
horror as a Catholic at the modern superstitions in favour
of popular opinion and control which it encourages. You
see, Lord Horsham, I am not a party man, only a little
less enthusiastic for the opposite cries than for his own.
You appealed very strangely to my feelings of patriotism
for this country; but you see even my own is&mdash;in the
twentieth century&mdash;foreign to me. From my point of
view neither Mr. Trebell, nor you, nor the men you have
just defeated, nor any discoverable man or body of men
will make laws which matter ... or differ in the slightest.
You are all part of your age and you all voice&mdash;though
in separate keys, or even tunes they may be&mdash;only the
greed and follies of your age. That you should do this
and nothing more is, of course, the democratic ideal. You
will forgive my thinking tenderly of the statesmanship of
the first Edward.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The library door opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Russell Blackborough</span>
<i>comes in. He has on evening clothes, complicated
by a long silk comforter and the motoring cap which he
carries.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. You know Russell Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I think not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. How d'you do?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>having bowed</i>, <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>having
nodded, the two men sit down</i>, <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>with
an air of great attention</i>, <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>to continue his
interrupted speech.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. And you are as far from me in your code of
personal morals as in your politics. In neither do you
seem to realise that such a thing as passion can exist. No
doubt you use the words Love and Hatred; but do you
know that love and hatred for principles or persons should
come from beyond a man? I notice you speak of forgiveness
as if it were a penny in my pocket. You have been
endeavouring for these two days to rouse me from my
indifference towards Mr. Trebell. Perhaps you are on
the point of succeeding ... but I do not know what you
may rouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I understand. We are much in agreement,
Mr. O'Connell. What can a man be&mdash;who has any pretensions
to philosophy&mdash;but helplessly indifferent to the
thousands of his fellow creatures whose fates are intertwined
with his?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I am glad that you understand. But,
again ... have I been wrong to shrink from personal
relations with Mr. Trebell? Hatred is as sacred a responsibility
as love. And you will not agree with me when
I say that punishment can be the salvation of a man's
soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>With aggressive common sense.</i>] Look here.
O'Connell, if you're indifferent it doesn't hurt you to let
him off. And if you hate him...! Well, one shouldn't
hate people ... there's no room for it in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Quietly as ever.</i>] We have some authority
for thinking that the punishment of a secret sin is awarded
by God secretly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. We have very poor authority, sir, for
using God's name merely to fill up the gaps in an argument,
though we may thus have our way easily with men who
fear God more than they know him. I am not one of
those. Yes, Farrant, you and your like have left little
room in this world except for the dusty roads on which
I notice you beginning once more to travel. The rule of
them is the same for all, is it not ... from the tramp and
the labourer to the plutocrat in his car? This is the age
of equality; and it's a fine practical equality ... the
equality of the road. But you've fenced the fields of
human joy and turned the very hillsides into hoardings,
Commercial opportunity is painted on them, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Not to be impressed.</i>] Perhaps it is
O'Connell. My father made his money out of newspapers
and I ride in a motor car and you came from Holyhead by
train. What has all that to do with it? Why can't you
make up your mind? You know in this sort of case one
talks a lot ... and then does the usual thing. You must
let Trebell off and that's all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. Indeed. And do they still think it worth
while to administer an oath to your witnesses?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is interrupted by the flinging open of the door
and the triumphant right-this-time-anyhow voice in
which</i> <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span> <i>announces</i> "Mr. Trebell, my
lord." <i>The general consternation expresses itself
through</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>, <i>who complains aloud and unreservedly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Good God.... No! Charles, I must give
him notice at once ... he'll have to go. [<i>He apologises
to the company.</i>] I beg your pardon.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>By this time</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>is in the room and has discovered
the stranger, who stands to face him without
emotion or anger</i>, <span class="smcap">Blackborough's</span> <i>face wears
the grimmest of smiles</i>, <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>is sorry</i>, <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>
<i>recovers from the fit of choking which seemed imminent
and</i> <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>, <i>dimly perceiving by now some fly in
the perfect amber of his conduct, departs. The two
men still face each other</i>, <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>is prepared to
separate them should they come to blows, and indeed
is advancing in that anticipation when</i> <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>
<i>speaks.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I am Justin O'Connell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I guess that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. There's a dead woman between us, Mr.
Trebell.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A tremor sweeps over</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span>; <i>then he speaks
simply.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I wish she had not died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. I am called upon by your friends to save
you from the consequences of her death. What have you
to say about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I have been wondering what sort of expression
the last of your care for her would find ... but not much.
My wonder is at the power over me that has been given to
something I despised.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Only</i> <span class="smcap">O'Connell</span> <i>grasps his meaning. But he,
stirred for the first time and to his very depths,
drives it home.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. Yes.... If I wanted revenge I have it.
She was a worthless woman. First my life and now yours!
Dead because she was afraid to bear your child, isn't she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>In agony.</i>] I'd have helped that if I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. Not the shame ... not the wrong she had
done me ... but just fear&mdash;fear of the burden of her
woman-hood. And because of her my children are
bastards and cannot inherit my name. And I must live
in sin against my church, as&mdash;God help me&mdash;I can't
against my nature. What are men to do when this is
how women use the freedom we have given them? Is the
curse of barrenness to be nothing to a man? And that's
the death in life to which you gentlemen with your fine
civilisation are bringing us. I think we are brothers in
misfortune, Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Far from responding.</i>] Not at all, sir. If
you wanted children you did the next best thing when she
left you. My own problem is neither so simple nor is it
yet anyone's business but my own. I apologise for
alluding to it.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>takes advantage of the silence that follows.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Shall we....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. [<i>Measuring</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>with his eyes.</i>] And
by which shall I help you to a solution ... telling lies or
the truth to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Roughly, almost insolently.</i>] If you want
my advice ... I should do the thing that comes more
easily to you, or that will content you most. If you haven't
yet made up your mind as to the relative importance of my
work and your conscience, it's too late to begin now. Nothing
you may do can affect me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. <i>[fluttering fearfully into this strange dispute.</i>]
O'Connell ... if you and I were to join Wedgecroft....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. You value your work more than anything
else in the world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Have I anything else in the world?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Connell</span>. Have you not? [<i>With grim ambiguity.</i>]
Then I am sorry for you, Mr. Trebell. [<i>Having said all
he had to say, he notices</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>.] Yes, Lord Horsham,
by all means....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Then</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>opens the library door and sees him
safely through. He passes</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>without any
salutation, nor does</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>turn after him; but
when</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>also is in the library and the door
is closed, comments viciously.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The man's a sentimentalist ... like all
men who live alone or shut away. [<i>Then surveying his
three glum companions, bursts out.</i>] Well...? We can
stop thinking of this dead woman, can't we? It's a waste
of time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Trebell, what did you want to come
here for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Because you thought I wouldn't. I knew
you'd be sitting round, incompetent with distress, calculating
to a nicety the force of a scandal....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>With the firmest of touches.</i>] Horsham
has called some of us here to discuss the situation.
I am considering my opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You are not, Blackborough. You haven't
recovered yet from the shock of your manly feelings. Oh,
cheer up. You know we're an adulterous and sterile
generation. Why should you cry out at a proof now and
then of what's always in the hearts of most of us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Plaintively.</i>] Now, for God's sake, Trebell
... O'Connell has been going on like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well then ... think of what matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Of you and your reputation in fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Kindly.</i>] Why do you pretend to be callous?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He strokes</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell's</span> <i>shoulder, who shakes him off
impatiently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Do you all mean to out-face the British Lion
with me after to-morrow ... dare to be Daniels?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Bravado won't carry this off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Blackborough ... it would immortalize you.
I'll stand up in my place in the House of Commons and tell
everything that has befallen soberly and seriously. Why
should I flinch?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. My dear Trebell, if your name comes out at
the inquest&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. If it does!... whose has been the real
offence against Society ... hers or mine? It's I who am
most offended ... if I choose to think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. You seem to forget the adultery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Isn't Death divorce enough for her? And ...
oh, wasn't I right?... What do you start thinking of once
the shock's over? Punishment ... revenge ... uselessness ... waste
of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>With finality.</i>] If your name comes out at
the inquest, to talk of anything but retirement from public
life is perfect lunacy ... and you know it.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>comes back from the passage. He is a
little distracted; then the more so at finding himself
again in a highly-charged atmosphere.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. He's gone off with Wedgecroft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Including</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>now in his appeal.</i>]
Does anyone think he knows me now to be a worse man ...
less fit, less able ... than he did a week ago?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>From the piano-stool comes</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe's</span> <i>quiet voice.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Yes, Trebell ... I do.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>wheels round at this and ceases all bluster.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. On what grounds?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Unarguable ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Finding refuge again in his mantelpiece.</i>]
You know, he has gone off without giving me his promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. That's your own fault, Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. The fool says I didn't give him explicit
instructions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. What fool?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. That man ... [<i>The name fails him.</i>] ... my
new man. One of those touches of Fate's little finger,
really.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He begins to consult the ceiling and the carpet once
more.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>tackles</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>with gravity.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I have only a logical mind, Cantelupe. I
know that to make myself a capable man I've purged myself
of all the sins ... I never was idle enough to commit. I
know that if your God didn't make use of men, sins and
all ... what would ever be done in the world? That one
natural action, which the slight shifting of a social law
could have made as negligible as eating a meal, can make
me incapable ... takes the linch-pin out of one's brain,
doesn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Trebell, we've been doing our best to get you
out of this mess. Your remarks to O'Connell weren't of
any assistance, and....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>stands up, so momentously that</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham's</span>
<i>gentle flow of speech dries up.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Perhaps I had better say at once that,
whatever hushing up you may succeed in, it will be
impossible for me to sit in a cabinet with Mr. Trebell.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>It takes even</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>a good half minute to recover
his power of speech on this new issue.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. What perfect nonsense, Cantelupe! I hope
you don't mean that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Complication number one, Horsham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Working up his protest.</i>] Why on earth
not? You really mustn't drag your personal feelings and
prejudices into important matters like this ... matters of
state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I think I have no choice, when Trebell
stands convicted of a mortal sin, of which he has not even
repented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With bitterest cynicism.</i>] Dictate any form
of repentance you like ... my signature is yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Is this a matter for intellectual jugglery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His defence failing at last.</i>] I offered to face
the scandal from my place in the House. That was mad,
wasn't it....</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>&mdash;<i>his course mapped out&mdash;changes
the tone of the discussion.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Horsham, I hope Trebell will believe
I have no personal feelings in this matter, but we may as
well face the fact even now that O'Connell holding his
tongue to-morrow won't stop gossip in the House, club
gossip, gossip in drawing rooms. What do the Radicals
really care so long as a scandal doesn't get into the papers!
There's an inner circle with its eye on us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Well, what does that care as long as scandal's
its own copyright? Do you know, my dear father refused
a peerage because he felt it meant putting blinkers
on his best newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>A little subtly.</i>] Still ... now you
and Horsham are cousins, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Off the track and explanatory.</i>] No, no ...
my wife's mother....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. I'm inaccurate, for I'm not one of
the family circle myself. My money gets me here and any
skill I've used in making it. It wouldn't keep me at a
pinch. And Trebell ... [<i>He speaks through his teeth.</i>] ...
do you think your accession to power in the party is popular
at the best? Who is going to put out a finger to make it
less awkward for Horsham to stick to you if there's a
chance of your going under?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>smiles at some mental picture he is
making.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Can your cousins and aunts make it so
awkward for you, Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Repaying humour with humour.</i>] I bear
up against their affectionate attentions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. But I quite understand how uncongenial I
may be. What made you take up with me at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Your brains, Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. He should have enquired into my character
first, shouldn't he, Cantelupe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With crushing sincerity.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, the old unnecessary choice ... Wisdom
or Virtue. We all think we must make it ... and we all
discover we can't. But if you've to choose between
Cantelupe and me, Horsham, I quite see you've no choice.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>now takes the field, using his own weapons.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Charles, it seems to me that we are somewhat
in the position of men who have overheard a private
conversation. Do you feel justified in making public
use of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. It is not I who am judge. God knows
I would not sit in judgment upon anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Cantelupe, I'll take your personal judgment
if you can give it me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Good Lord, Cantelupe, didn't you sit in a
cabinet with ... Well, we're not here to rake up old
scandals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. I am concerned with the practical
issue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. We know, Blackborough. [<i>Having quelled
the interruption he proceeds.</i>] Charles, you spoke, I think,
of a mortal sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. In spite of your lifted eyebrows at the
childishness of the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Theoretically, we must all wish to guide
ourselves by eternal truths. But you would admit,
wouldn't you, that we can only deal with temporal things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Writhing slightly under the sceptical
cross-examination.</i>] There are divine laws laid down for
our guidance ... I admit no disbelief in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Do they place any time-limit to the effect
of a mortal sin? If this affair were twenty years old would
you do as you are doing? Can you forecast the opinion
you will have of it six months hence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Positively.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Can you? Nevertheless I wish you had
postponed your decision even till to-morrow.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Having made his point he looks round almost for
approval.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. What had Percival to say on the
subject, Farrant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. I was only to make use of his opinion under
certain circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. So it isn't favourable to your remaining
with us, Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Indignantly emerging from the trap.</i>] I
never said that.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Now</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>gives the matter another turn, very
forcefully.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Horsham ... I don't bow politely and stand
aside at this juncture as a gentleman should, because I
want to know how the work's to be done if I leave you what
I was to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Are we so incompetent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I daresay not. I want to know ... that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Please understand, Mr. Trebell, that I
have in no way altered my good opinion of your proposals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Well, I beg to remind you, Horsham,
that from the first I've reserved myself liberty to criticise
fundamental points in the scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Pacifically.</i>] Quite so ... quite so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. That nonsensical new standard of
teachers' salaries for one thing ... you'd never pass it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Quite easily. It's an administrative point,
so leave the legislation vague. Then, as the appropriation
money falls in, the qualifications rise and the salaries rise.
No one will object because no one will appreciate it but
administrators past or future ... and they never cavil at
money. [<i>He remains lost in the beauty of this prospect.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Will you take charge of the bill, Blackborough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Are you serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Brought to earth.</i>] Oh no! [<i>He corrects
himself smiling.</i>] I mean, my dear Blackborough, why
not stick to the Colonies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. You see, Trebell, there's still the
possibility that O'Connell may finally spike your gun to-morrow.
You realise that, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Thank you. I quite realise that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Can nothing further be done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Weren't we doing our best?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Yes ... if we were bending our thoughts
to that difficulty now....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Hardly.</i>] May I ask you to interfere on
my behalf no further?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. My dear Trebell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I assure you that I am interested in the
Disestablishment Bill.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>So they turn readily enough from the more uncomfortable
part of their subject.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Well ... here's Farrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. I'm no good. Give me Agriculture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Pity you're in the Lords, Horsham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Horsham, I'll devil for any man you choose
to name ... feed him sentence by sentence....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. That's impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well, what's to become of my bill? I want
to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Casting his care on Providence.</i>] We
shall manage somehow. Why, if you had died suddenly ...
or let us say, never been born....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then, Blackborough ... speaking as a dying
man ... if you go back on the integrity of this scheme,
I'll haunt you. [<i>Having said this with some finality, he
turns his back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Cyril, I agree with what Trebell is saying.
Whatever happens there must be no tampering with the
comprehensiveness of the scheme. Remember you are in
the hands of the extremists ... on both sides. I won't
support a compromise on one ... nor will they on the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Well, I'll confess to you candidly, Trebell,
that I don't know of any man available for this piece of
work but you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then I should say it would be almost a
relief to you if O'Connell tells on me to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. We seem to have got off that subject altogether.
[<i>There comes a portentous tap at the door.</i>] Good
Lord!... I'm getting jumpy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A note is handed to him through the half opened
door; and obviously it is at</i> <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span> <i>whom he
frowns. Then he returns fidgetting for his glasses.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, it turns out ... I'm so sorry you were blundered in
here, Trebell ... this man ... what's his name ... Edwards ...
had been reading the papers and thought it was a cabinet
council ... seemed proud of himself. This is from
Wedgecroft ... scribbled in a messenger office. I never
can read his writing ... it's like prescriptions. Can you?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>It has gradually dawned on the three men and then
on</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>what this note may have in it.</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>
<i>hand even trembles a little as he takes it. He gathers
the meaning himself and looks at the others with a
smile before he reads the few words aloud.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. "All right. He has promised."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Thank God. [<i>He turns enthusiastically to</i>
<span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>who stands rigid.</i>] My dear fellow ... I hope
you know how glad I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I am very glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Of course we're all very glad indeed,
Trebell ... very glad we persuaded him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. That's dead and buried now, isn't it?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>moves away from them all and leaves them
wondering. When he turns round his face is as hard
as ever; his voice, if possible, harder.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. But, Horsham, returning to the more important
question ... you've taken trouble, and O'Connell's
to perjure himself for nothing if you still can't get me into
your child's puzzle ... to make the pretty picture that a
Cabinet should be.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>and scents danger.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. We shall all be glad, I am sure, to postpone
any further discussion....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I shall not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Encouragingly.</i>] Quite so, Trebell.
We're on the subject, and it won't discount our pleasure
that you're out of this mess, to continue it. This habit of
putting off the hour of disagreement is ... well, Horsham,
it's contrary to my business instincts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. If one time's as good as another for you ...
this moment is better than most for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>A little irritated at the wantonness of this
dispute.</i>] There is nothing before us on which we are
capable of coming to any decision ... in a technical sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. That's a quibble. [<i>Poor</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>
<i>gasps.</i>] I'm not going to pretend either now or in a
month's time that I think Trebell anything but a most
dangerous acquisition to the party. I pay you a compliment
in that, Trebell. Now, Horsham proposes that we
should go to the country when Disestablishment's through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. It's the condition of Nonconformist support.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. One condition. Then you'd leave us,
Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. And carry with you the credit of our
one big measure. Consider the effect upon our reputation
with the Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Waking to</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough's</span> <i>line of action.</i>]
Why on earth should you leave us, Trebell? You've
hardly been a Liberal, even in name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Vigorously making his point.</i>] Then
what would be the conditions of your remaining? You're
not a party man, Trebell. You haven't the true party feeling.
You are to be bought. Of course you take your
price in measures, not in money. But you are preeminently
a man of ideas ... an expert. And a man of ideas is
often a grave embarrassment to a government.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. And vice-versa ... vice-versa!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Facing</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>across the room.</i>]
Do I understand that you for the good of the Tory party ...
just as Cantelupe for the good of his soul ... will refuse to
sit in a cabinet with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Unembarrassed.</i>] I don't commit
myself to saying that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. No, Trebell ... it's that I must believe
your work could not prosper ... in God's way.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>softens to his sincerity.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Cantelupe, I quite understand. You may
be right ... it's a very interesting question. Blackborough,
I take it that you object first of all to the scheme that I'm
bringing you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. I object to those parts of it which I
don't think you'll get through the House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Feeling that he must take part.</i>] For
instance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. I've given you one already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>His eye on</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>.] Understand
there are things in that scheme we must stand or fall
by.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Suddenly</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>makes for the door</i>, <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>
<i>gets up concernedly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Horsham, make up your mind to-night
whether you can do with me or not. I have to see Percival
again to-morrow ... we cut short our argument at the
important point. Good-bye ... don't come down. Will
you decide to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I have made up my own mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Is that sufficient?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. A collective decision is a matter of development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well, I shall expect to hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. By hurrying one only reaches a rash conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Then be rash for once and take the consequences.
Good-night.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is gone before</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>can compose another
epigram.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Deprecating such conduct.</i>] Lost his
temper!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Ruffling considerably.</i>] Horsham, if Trebell
is to be hounded out of your cabinet ... he won't go alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Bitter-sweet.</i>] My dear Farrant ... I
have yet to form my cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. You are forming it to carry disestablishment,
are you not, Cyril? Therefore you will form it in the
best interests of the best scheme possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Trebell was and is the best man I know of
for the purpose. I'm a little weary of saying that.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He folds his arms and awaits further developments.
After a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>gets up as if to address a
meeting.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Then if you would prefer not to include
me ... I shall feel justified in giving independent support
to a scheme I have great faith in. [<i>And he sits
down again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Impatiently.</i>] My dear Cantelupe,
if you think Horsham can form a disestablishment cabinet
to include Trebell and exclude you, you're vastly mistaken.
I for one....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. But do both of you consider how valuable,
how vital Trebell is to us just at this moment? The
Radicals trust him....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. They hate him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Elucidating.</i>] Their front bench hates
him because he turned them out. The rest of them hate
their front bench. After six years of office, who wouldn't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. That's true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Oh, of course, we must stick to Trebell,
Blackborough.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>is silent; so</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>turns his
attention to his cousin.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Well, Charles, I won't ask you for a decision
now. I know how hard it is to accept the dictates of
other men's consciences ... but a necessary condition
of all political work; believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Uneasily.</i>] You can form your cabinet
without me, Cyril.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>charges down on them, so to
speak.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. No, I tell you, I'm damned if he can.
Leaving the whole high church party to blackmail all
they can out of us and vote how they like! Here ... I've
got my Yorkshire people to think of. I can bargain for
them with you in a cabinet ... not if you've the pull
of being out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>With charming insinuation.</i>] And have
you calculated, Blackborough, what may become of us if
Trebell has the pull of being out of it?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>makes a face.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Yes ... I suppose he might turn
nasty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. I should hope he would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>.[<i>Tackling</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>with great ease.</i>]
I should hope he would consider the matter not from the
personal, but from the political point of view ... as I am
trying to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Tasting his epigram with enjoyment.</i>]
Introspection is the only bar to such an honourable endeavour,
[<span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>gapes.</i>] You don't suffer from
that as&mdash;for instance&mdash;Charles here, does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Pugnaciously.</i>] D'you mean I'm
just pretending not to attack him personally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Safe on his own ground.</i>] It's only a
curious metaphysical point. Have you never noticed
your distaste for the colour of a man's hair translate
itself ultimately into an objection to his religious opinions
... or what not? I am sure&mdash;for instance&mdash;I could trace
Charles's scruples about sitting in a cabinet with Trebell
back to a sort of academic reverence for women generally
which he possesses. I am sure I could ... if he were not
probably now doing it himself. But this does not make the
scruples less real, less religious, or less political. We
must be humanly biased in expression ... or not express
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Whose thoughts have wandered.</i>] The
man's less of a danger than he was ... I mean he'll
be alone. The Liberals won't have him back. He
smashed his following there to come over to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Giving a further meaning to this.</i>] Yes,
Blackborough, he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. To gain his own ends! Oh, my dear
Horsham, can't you see that if O'Connell had blabbed to-morrow
it really would have been a blessing in disguise? I
don't pretend to Cantelupe's standard ... but there must
be something radically wrong with a man who could get
himself into such a mess as that ... now mustn't there?
Ah! ... you have a fatal partiality for clever people. I
tell you ... though this might be patched up ... Trebell
would fail us in some other way before we were six months
older.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This speech has its effect; but</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>looks at him
a little sternly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. And am I to conclude that you don't want
Charles to change his mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>On another tack.</i>] Farrant has not
yet allowed us to hear Percival's opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>looks rather alarmed.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. It has very little reference to the scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. As that is at an end ... all the more
reason we should hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Ranging himself with</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>.] I called
this quite informal meeting, Blackborough, only to dispose
of the scandal, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Well, of course, if Farrant chooses to
insult Percival so gratuitously by burking his message to
us....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is an unspoken threat in this</i>, <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>sees
it and without disguising his irritation....</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Let us have it, Farrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>With a sort of puzzled discontent.</i>] Well ...
I never got to telling him of the O'Connell affair at all.
He started talking to me ... saying that he couldn't for a
moment agree to Trebell's proposals for the finance of his
bill ... I couldn't get a word in edgeways. Then his wife
came up....</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>takes something in this so seriously that he
actually interrupts.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Does he definitely disagree? What is his
point?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. He says Disestablishment's a bad enough
speculation for the party as it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. It is inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. He sees that. But then he says ... to go
to the country again having bolstered up Education and
quarrelled with everybody will be bad enough ... to go
having spent fifty millions on it will dish us all for our
lifetimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. What does he propose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. He'll offer to draft another bill and take it
through himself. He says ... do as many good turns as we
can with the money ... don't put it all on one horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. He's your man, Horsham. That's
one difficulty settled.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham's</span> <i>thoughts are evidently beyond</i>
<span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>, <i>beyond the absent</i> <span class="smcap">Percival</span> <i>even.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Oh ... any of us could carry that sort of a
bill.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>has heard this last passage with nothing
less than horror and pale anger, which he contains
no longer.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I won't have this. I won't have this
opportunity frittered away for party purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Expostulating reasonably.</i>] My dear
Cantelupe ... you'll get whatever you think it right for the
Church to have. You carry a solid thirty eight votes
with you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham's</span> <i>smooth voice intervenes. He speaks
with finesse.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Percival, as an old campaigner, expresses
himself very roughly. The point is, that we are after all
only the trustees of the party. If we know that a certain
step will decimate it ... clearly we have no right to take
the step.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Glowing to white heat.</i>] Is this a time to
count the consequences to ourselves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Unkindly.</i>] By your action this evening,
Charles, you evidently think not. [<i>He salves the wound.</i>]
No matter, I agree with you ... the bill should be a comprehensive
one, whoever brings it in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Not without enjoyment of the situation.</i>]
Whoever brings it in will have to knuckle under to
Percival over its finance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Trebell won't do that. I warned Percival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Then what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. He only swore.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>suddenly becomes peevish.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I think, Farrant, you should have given me
this message before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. My dear Horsham, what had it to do with
our request to O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Scolding the company generally.</i>] Well
then, I wish he hadn't sent it. I wish we were not discussing
these points at all. The proper time for them is at
a cabinet meeting. And when we have actually assumed
the responsibilities of government ... then threats of
resignation are not things to be played about with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Did you expect Percival's objection to the
finance of the scheme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Perhaps ... perhaps. I knew Trebell was
to see him last Tuesday. I expect everybody's objections
to any parts of every scheme to come at a time when I am
in a proper position to reconcile them ... not now.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Having vented his grievances he sits down to recover.</i>

pause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. It isn't so easy for me to speak against
Trebell, since he evidently dislikes me personally as much
as I dislike him ... but I'm sure I'm doing my duty.
Horsham ... here you have Cantelupe who won't stand
in with the man, and Percival who won't stand in with
his measure, while I would sooner stand in with neither.
Isn't it better to face the situation now than take trouble to
form the most makeshift of Cabinets, and if that doesn't go
to pieces, be voted down in the House by your own party?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is an oppressive silence,</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>is sulky.
The matter is beyond</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>whose
agonies have expressed themselves in slight writhings,
at last, with an effort, writhes himself to his feet.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I think I am prepared to reconsider my
decision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. That's all right then!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He looks round wonderingly for the rest of the chorus
to find that neither</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>nor</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>
<i>have stirred.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Stealthily.</i>] Is it, Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Sotto voce.</i>] Why did you ever make it?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>leaves him for</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. You're afraid for the integrity of
the bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. It must be comprehensive ... that's vital.
<span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Very forcefully.</i>] I give you my
word to support its integrity, if you'll keep with me in
persuading Horsham that the inclusion of Trebell in his
cabinet will be a blow to the whole Conservative Cause.
Horsham, I implore you not to pursue this short-sighted
policy. All parties have made up their minds to Disestablishment
... surely nothing should be easier than to
frame a bill which will please all parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>At last perceiving the drift of all this.</i>] But
good Lord, Blackborough ... now Cantelupe has come
round and will stand in ...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. That's no longer the point. And
what's all this nonsense about going to the country again
next year?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Mildly.</i>] After consulting me Percival
said at Bristol....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Quite unchecked.</i>] I know. But if
we pursue a thoroughly safe policy and the bye-elections
go right ... there need be no vote of censure carried for
three or four years. The Radicals want a rest with the
country and they know it. And one has no right, what's
more, to go wantonly plunging the country into the expenses
of these constant general elections. It ruins trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Forlornly sticking to his point.</i>] What has
all this to do with Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] Farrant, beyond what
you've told us, Percival didn't recommend me to throw
him over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. No, he didn't ... that is, he didn't exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Well ... he didn't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. I'm trying to be accurate! [<i>Obviously their
nerves are now on edge.</i>] He said we should find him
tough to assimilate&mdash;as he warned you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>with knit brows, loses himself in thought
again,</i> <span class="smcap">Blackborough</span> <i>quietly turns his attention
to</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Farrant, you don't seriously think
that ... outside his undoubted capabilities ... Trebell is an
acquisition to the party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Unwillingly.</i>] Perhaps not. But if you're
going to chuck a man ... don't chuck him when he's
down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. He's no longer down. We've got
him O'Connell's promise and jolly grateful he ought to
be. I think the least we can do is to keep our minds clear
between Trebell's advantage and the party's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>From the distant music-stool.</i>] And the
party's and the Country's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Countering quite deftly.</i>] Cantelupe,
either we think it best for the country to have our party in
power or we don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>In judicious temper.</i>] Certainly, I don't
feel our responsibility towards him is what it was ten
minutes ago. The man has other careers besides his
political one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Ready to praise.</i>] Clever as paint
at the Bar&mdash;best Company lawyer we've got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. It is not what he loses, I think ... but
what we lose in losing him.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He says this so earnestly that</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>pays attention.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. No, my dear Charles, let us be practical.
If his position with us is to be made impossible it is better
that he shouldn't assume it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Soft and friendly.</i>] How far are you
actually pledged to him?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>looks up with the most ingenuous of smiles.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. That's always such a difficult sort of point
to determine, isn't it? He thinks he is to join us. But I've
not yet been commanded to form a cabinet. If neither
you&mdash;nor Percival&mdash;nor perhaps others will work with him
... what am I to do? [<i>He appeals to them generally to
justify this attitude.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. He no longer thinks he's to join us ...
it's the question he left us to decide.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He leaves</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>, <i>whose perplexity is diminishing.</i>
<span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>makes an effort.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. But the scandal won't weaken his position
with us now. There won't be any scandal ... there won't,
Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. There may be. Though, I take it we're all
guiltless of having mentioned the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>Very detached.</i>] I've only known of
it since I came into this house ... but I shall not mention
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. Oh, I'm afraid my wife knows. [<i>He adds
hastily.</i>] My fault ... my fault entirely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. I tell you Rumour's electric.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>has turned to</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>with a sweet smile
and with the air of a man about to be relieved of all
responsibility.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. What does she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>As one speaks of a nice woman.</i>] She was
horrified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Of course. [<i>Once more he finds refuge and
comfort on the hearthrug, to say, after a moment, with fine
resignation.</i>] I suppose I must let him go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>On his feet again.</i>] Cyril!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Yes, Charles?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>With this query he turns an accusing eye on</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>,
<i>who is silenced.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Have you made up your mind to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>In great distress.</i>] You're wrong, Horsham.
[<i>Then in greater.</i>] That is ... I think you're wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I'd sooner not let him know to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. But he asked you to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>All show of resistance gone.</i>] Did he?
Then I suppose I must. [<i>He sighs deeply.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Then I'll get back to Aylesbury.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He picks up his motor-cap from the table and settles
it on his head with immense aplomb.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. So late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Really one can get along quicker at
night if one knows the road. You're in town, aren't you,
Farrant? Shall I drop you at Grosvenor Square?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Ungraciously.</i>] Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. [<i>With a conqueror's geniality.</i>] I
don't mind telling you now, Horsham, that ever since we
met at Shapters I've been wondering how you'd escape
from this association with Trebell. Thought he was
being very clever when he crossed the House to us! It's
needed a special providence. You'd never have got a
cabinet together to include him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>With much intention.</i>] No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. [<i>Miserably.]</i> Yes, I suppose that intrigue
was a mistake from the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Well, good-night. [<i>As he turns to go
he finds</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>upright, staring very sternly at him.</i>]
Good-night, Cantelupe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. From what motives have we thrown
Trebell over?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackborough</span>. Never mind the motives if the move
is the right one. [<i>Then he nods at</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>.] I shall
be up again next week if you want me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>And he flourishes out of the room; a man who has
done a good hour's work</i>, <span class="smcap">Farrant</span>, <i>who has been
mooning depressedly around, now backs towards the
door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Farrant</span>. In one way, of course, Trebell won't care a
damn. I mean, he knows as well as we do that office isn't
worth having ... he has never been a place-hunter. On
the other hand ... what with one thing and the other ...
Blackborough is a sensible fellow. I suppose it can't be
helped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Blackborough will tell you so. Good-night.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>So</i> <span class="smcap">Farrant</span> <i>departs, leaving the two cousins together.</i>
<span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>has not moved and now faces</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span>
<i>just as accusingly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Cyril, this is tragic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>More to himself than in answer.</i>] Yes ...
most annoying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Lucifer, son of the morning! Why is it
always the highest who fall?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>shies fastidiously at this touch of poetry.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. No, my dear Charles, let us above all
things keep our mental balance. Trebell is a most
capable fellow. I'd set my heart on having him with me ...
he'll be most awkward to deal with in opposition. But
we shall survive his loss and so would the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Desperately.</i>] Cyril, promise me there
shall be no compromise over this measure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Charmingly candid.</i>] No ... no unnecessary
compromise, I promise you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With a sigh.</i>] If we had done what we
have done to-night in the right spirit! Blackborough was
almost vindictive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Smiling without amusement.</i>] Didn't you
keep thinking ... I did ... of that affair of his with Mrs.
Parkington ... years ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. There was never any proof of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. No ... he bought off the husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Uneasily.</i>] His objections to Trebell
were&mdash;political.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Yours weren't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>More uneasily still.</i>] I withdrew
mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>With elderly reproof.</i>] I don't think,
Charles, you have the least conception of what a nicely
balanced machine a cabinet is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Imploring comfort.</i>] But should we have
held together through Trebell's bill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>A little impatient.</i>] Perhaps not. But
once I had them all round a table ... Trebell is very keen
on office for all his independent airs ... he and Percival
could have argued the thing out. However, it's too late
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Is it?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>For a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>is tempted to indulge in the
luxury of changing his mind; but he puts Satan
behind him with a shake of the head.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Well, you see ... Percival I can't do without.
Now that Blackborough knows of his objections
to the finance he'd go to him and take Chisholm and offer
to back them up. I know he would ... he didn't take
Farrant away with him for nothing. [<i>Then he flashes out
rather shrilly.</i>] It's Trebell's own fault. He ought not to
have committed himself definitely to any scheme until he
was safely in office. I warned him about Percival ... I
warned him not to be explicit. One cannot work with
men who will make up their minds prematurely. No, I
shall not change my mind. I shall write to him.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes firmly to his writing desk leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>
<i>forlorn.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. What about a messenger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Not at this time of night. I'll post it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. I'll post it as I go.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He seeks comfort again in the piano and this time
starts to play, with one finger and some hesitation,
the first bars of a Bach fugue</i>, <span class="smcap">Horsham's</span> <i>pen-nib
is disappointing him and the letter is not easy to
phrase.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. But I hate coming to immediate decisions.
The administrative part of my brain always tires after
half an hour. Does yours, Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. What do you think Trebell will do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>A little grimly.</i>] Punish us all he can.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>On reaching the second voice in the fugue</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe's</span>
<i>virtuosity breaks down.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. All that ability turned to destructiveness ...
what a pity! That's the paradox of human activities....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Suddenly</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>looks up and his face is lighted
with a seraphic smile.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Charles ... I wish we could do without
Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>Struck with the idea.</i>] Well ... why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. Yes ... I must think about it. [<i>They
both get up, cheered considerably.</i>] You won't forget this,
will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>The letter in</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham's</span> <i>hand accusing
him.</i>] No ... no. I don't think I have been the cause
of your dropping Trebell, have I?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>, <i>rid of the letter, is rid of responsibility
and his charming equable self again. He comforts
his cousin paternally.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. I don't think so. The split would have
come when Blackborough checkmated my forming a
cabinet. It would have pleased him to do that ... and he
could have, over Trebell. But now that question's out of
the way ... you won't get such a bad measure with
Trebell in opposition. He'll frighten us into keeping it up
to the mark, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>A little comforted.</i>] But I shall miss
one or two of those ideas ...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>So pleasantly sceptical.</i>] Do you think
they'd have outlasted the second reading? Dullness in the
country one expects. Dullness in the House one can cope
with. But do you know, I have never sat in a cabinet
yet that didn't greet anything like a new idea in chilling
silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. Well, I should regret to have caused you
trouble, Cyril.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>His hand on the other's shoulder.</i>] Oh ...
we don't take politics so much to heart as that, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>. [<i>With sweet gravity.</i>] I take politics very
much to heart. Yes, I know what you mean ... but that's
the sort of remark that makes people call you cynical.
[<span class="smcap">Horsham</span> <i>smiles as if at a compliment and starts with</i>
<span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span> <i>towards the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Cantelupe</span>, <i>who would not
hurt his feelings, changes the subject.</i>] By the bye, I'm
glad we met this evening! Do you hear Aunt Mary wants
to sell the Burford Holbein? Can she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horsham</span>. [<i>Taking as keen, but no keener, an interest in
this than in the difficulty he has just surmounted.</i>] Yes,
by the will she can, but she mustn't. Dear me, I thought
I'd put a stop to that foolishness. Well now, we must
take that matter up very seriously ...</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They go out talking arm in arm.</i></p></blockquote>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE FOURTH ACT</h2>


<p>At <span class="smcap">Trebell's</span> again; later, the same evening.</p>

<p><i>His room is in darkness but for the flicker the fire makes
and the streaks of moonlight between the curtains.
The door is open, though, and you see the
light of the lamp on the stairs. You hear his
footstep too. On his way he stops to draw back the
the curtains of the passage-way window; the moonlight
makes his face look very pale. Then he serves
the curtains of his own window the same; flings it
open, moreover, and stands looking out. Something
below draws his attention. After leaning over
the balcony with a short</i> "Hullo" <i>he goes quickly
downstairs again. In a minute</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>comes
up.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>follows, pausing by the door a moment
to light up the room.</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>is radiant.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>With a twist of his mouth.</i>] Promised, has
he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Suddenly broke out as we walked along,
that he liked the look of you and that men must stand by
one another nowadays against these women. Then he
said good-night and walked away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Back to Ireland and the thirteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. After to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Taking all the meaning of to-morrow.</i>] Yes.
Are you in for perjury, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>His thankfulness checked a little.</i>]
No ... not exactly.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>walks away from him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It's a pity the truth isn't to be told, I think. I
suppose the verdict will be murder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. They won't catch the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You don't mean ... me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. No, no ... my dear fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You might, you know. But nobody seems
to see this thing as I see it. If I were on that jury I'd say
murder too and accuse ... so many circumstances,
Gilbert, that we should go home ... and look in the cupboards.
What a lumber of opinions we inherit and keep!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Humouring him.</i>] Ought we to burn
the house down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Rules and regulations for the preservation of
rubbish are the laws of England ... and I was adding to
their number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. And so you shall ... to the applause of a
grateful country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Studying his friend's kindly encouraging
face.</i>] Gilbert, it is not so much that you're an incorrigible
optimist ... but why do you subdue your mind to flatter
people into cheerfulness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'm a doctor, my friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You're a part of our tendency to keep things
alive by hook or by crook ... not a spark but must be
carefully blown upon. The world's old and tired; it
dreads extinction. I think I disapprove ... I think I've
more faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Scolding him.</i>] Nonsense ... you've
the instinct to preserve your life as everyone else has ...
and I'm here to show you how.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Beyond the reach of his kindness.</i>] I
assure you that these two days while you've been fussing
around O'Connell&mdash;bless your kind heart&mdash;I've been waiting
events, indifferent enough to understand his indifference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Not indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Lifeless enough already, then. [<i>Suddenly
a thought strikes him.</i>] D'you think it was Horsham and
his little committee persuaded O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. On the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. So you need not have let them into
the secret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Think of that.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He almost laughs; but</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>goes on quite
innocently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Yes ... I'm sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Upsetting their moral digestion for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. But when O'Connell wouldn't listen to
us we had to rope in the important people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. With their united wisdom. [<i>Then he breaks
away again into great bitterness.</i>] No ... what do they
make of this woman's death? I saw them in that room,
Gilbert, like men seen through the wrong end of a telescope.
D'you think if the little affair with Nature ... her offence
and mine against the conveniences of civilization ... had
ended in my death too ... then they'd have stopped to
wonder at the misuse and waste of the only force there
is in the world ... come to think of it, there is no other ...
than this desire for expression ... in words ... or through
children. Would they have thought of that and stopped
whispering about the scandal?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Through this</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>has watched him very
gravely.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Trebell ... if the inquest to-morrow
had put you out of action ...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Should I have grown a beard and travelled
abroad and after ten years timidly tried to climb my way
back into politics? When public opinion takes its heel from
your face it keeps it for your finger-tips. After twenty
years to be forgiven by your more broad-minded friends
and tolerated as a dotard by a new generation....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Nonsense. What age are you now ...
forty-six ... forty-seven?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well ... let's instance a good man. Gladstone
had done his best work by sixty-five. Then he began
to be popular. Think of his last years of oratory.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He has gone to his table and now very methodically
starts to tidy his papers,</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>still watching
him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You'd have had to thank Heaven for a
little that there were more lives than one to lead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. That's another of your faults, Gilbert ...
it's a comfort just now to enumerate them. You're an
anarchist ... a kingdom to yourself. You make little
treaties with Truth and with Beauty, and what can disturb
you? I'm a part of the machine I believe in. If my life
as I've made it is to be cut short ... the rest of me shall
walk out of the world and slam the door ... with the
noise of a pistol shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Concealing some uneasiness.</i>] Then
I'm glad it's not to be cut short. You and your cabinet
rank and your disestablishment bill!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>starts to enjoy his secret.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... our minds have been much relieved
within the last half hour, haven't they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I scribbled Horsham a note in a messenger
office and sent it as soon as O'Connell had left me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. He'd be glad to get that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. He has been most kind about the whole
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh, he means well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Following up his fancied advantage.</i>]
But, my friend ... suicide whilst of unsound mind would
never have done.... The hackneyed verdict hits the truth,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I don't say there aren't excuses enough
in this miserable world, but fundamentally ... no sane
person will destroy life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His thoughts shifting their plane.</i>] Was she
so very mad? I'm not thinking of her own death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Don't brood, Trebell. Your mind
isn't healthy yet about her and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. And my child.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Even</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft's</span> <i>kindness is at fault before the
solemnity of this.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Is that how you're thinking of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. How else? It's very inexplicable ... this
sense of fatherhood. [<i>The eyes of his mind travel down&mdash;what
vista of possibilities. Then he shakes himself free.</i>]
Let's drop the subject. To finish the list of shortcomings,
you're a bit of an artist too ... therefore I don't think
you'll understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Successfully decoyed into argument.</i>]
Surely an artist is a man who understands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Everything about life, but not life itself.
That's where art fails a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. That's where everything but living fails
a man. [<i>Drifting into introspection himself.</i>] Yes, it's true.
I can talk cleverly and I've written a book ... but I'm
barren. [<i>Then the healthy mind re-asserts itself.</i>] No,
it's not true. Our thoughts are children ... and marry
and intermarry. And we're peopling the world ... not
badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Well ... either life is too little a thing to
matter or it's so big that such specks of it as we may be are
of no account. These are two points of view. And then
one has to consider if death can't be sometimes the last
use made of life.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is a tone of menace in this which recalls</i>
<span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>to the present trouble.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I doubt the virtue of sacrifice ... or the
use of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. How else could I tell Horsham that my work
matters? Does he think so now?... not he.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. You mean if they'd had to throw you
over?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Once again</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>looks up with that secretive
smile.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... if they'd had to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Unreasonably nervous, so he thinks.</i>]
My dear fellow, Horsham would have thought it was the
shame and disgrace if you'd shot yourself after the inquest.
That's the proper sentimental thing for you so-called
strong men to do on like occasions. Why, if your name
were to come out to-morrow, your best meaning friends
would be sending you pistols by post, requesting you to
use them like a gentleman. Horsham would grieve over
ten dinner-tables in succession and then return to his
philosophy. One really mustn't waste a life trying to
shock polite politicians. There'd even be a suspicion of
swagger in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Quite so ... the bomb that's thrown at their
feet must be something otherwise worthless.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>comes in quickly, evidently in search of her
brother. Though she has not been crying, her eyes
are wide with grief.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Oh, Henry ... I'm so glad you're still up.
[<i>She notices</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>.] How d'you do, Doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Doubling his mask of indifference.</i>] Meistersinger's
over early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Not much past twelve yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>The little gibe lost on her.</i>] It was Tristan
to-night. I'm quite upset. I heard just as I was coming
away ... Amy O'Connell's dead. [<i>Both men hold their
breath.</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>is the first to find control of his and give
the cue.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... Wedgecroft has just told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. She was only taken ill last week ... it's so
extraordinary. [<i>She remembers the doctor.</i>] Oh ... have
you been attending her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I hear there's to be an inquest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. But what has been the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Sharply forestalling any answer.</i>] You'll
know to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>The little snub almost bewildering her.</i>] Anything
private? I mean....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No ... I'll tell you. Don't make Gilbert
repeat a story twice.... He's tired with a good day's work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Yes ... I'll be getting away.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>never heeds this flash of a further meaning
between the two men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. And I meant to have gone to see her to-day.
Was the end very sudden? Did her husband arrive in time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. They didn't get on ... he'll be frightfully
upset.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>resists a hideous temptation to laugh.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Good night, Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Good night, Gilbert. Many thanks.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is enough of a caress in</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell's</span> <i>tone to
turn</i> <span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>towards their friend, a little remorseful
for treating him so casually, now as always.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. He's always thanking you. You're always
doing things for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Good night. [<i>Seeing the tears in her
eyes.</i>] Oh, don't grieve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. One shouldn't be sorry when people die, I
know. But she liked me more than I liked her ... [<i>This
time</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>does laugh, silently.</i>] ... so I somehow feel
in her debt and unable to pay now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>An edge on his voice.</i>] Yes ... people
keep on dying at all sorts of ages, in all sorts of ways. But
we seem never to get used to it ... narrow-minded as we
are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Don't you talk nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>One note sharper yet.</i>] One should occasionally
test one's sanity by doing so. If we lived in the
logical world we like to believe in, I could also prove that
black was white. As it is ... there are more ways of
killing a cat than hanging it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Had I better give you a sleeping draught?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Are you doctoring him for once? Henry,
have you at last managed to overwork yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No ... I started the evening by a charming
little dinner at the Van Meyer's ... sat next to Miss Grace
Cutler, who is writing a <i>vie intime</i> of Louis Quinze and
engaged me with anecdotes of the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. A champion of her sex, whom I do not like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. She's writing such a book to prove that
women are equal to anything.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He goes towards the door and</i> <span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>goes with him.</i>
<span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>never turns his head.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I shall not come and open the door for you ...
but mind you shut it.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>comes back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Henry ... this is dreadful about that poor
little woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. An unwelcome baby was arriving. She got
some quack to kill her.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>These exact words are like a blow in the face to her,
from which, being a woman of brave common sense,
she does not shrink.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. What do you say to that?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She walks away from him, thinking painfully.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. She had never had a child. There's the
common-place thing to say.... Ungrateful little fool!
But....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. If you had been in her place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Subtly.</i>] I have never made the mistake of
marrying. She grew frightened, I suppose. Not just
physically frightened. How can a man understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The fear of life ... do you think it was ...
which is the beginning of all evil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. A woman must choose what her interpretation
of life is to be ... as a man must too in his way ...
as you and I have chosen, Henry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Asking from real interest in her.</i>] Was
yours a deliberate choice and do you never regret it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Very simply and clearly.</i>] Perhaps one does
nothing quite deliberately and for a definite reason. My
state has its compensations ... if one doesn't value them
too highly. I've travelled in thought over all this question.
You mustn't blame a woman for wishing not to bear children.
But ... well, if one doesn't like the fruit one mustn't
cultivate the flower. And I suppose that saying condemns
poor Amy ... condemned her to death ... [<i>Then her
face hardens as she concentrates her meaning.</i>] and brands
most men as ... let's unsentimentally call it illogical,
doesn't it?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He takes the thrust in silence.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Did you notice the light in my window as
you came in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Yes ... in both as I got out of the cab. Do
you want the curtains drawn back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... don't touch them.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He has thrown himself into his chair by the fire.
She lapses into thought again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Poor little woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>In deep anger.</i>] Well, if women will be
little and poor....</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She goes to him and slips an arm over his shoulder.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. What is it you're worried about ... if a mere
sister may ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Into the fire.</i>] I want to think. I haven't
thought for years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Why, you have done nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I've been working out problems in legal and
political algebra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. You want to think of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Gentle and ironic.</i>] Have you ever, for one
moment, thought in that sense of anyone else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Is that a complaint?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. The first in ten years' housekeeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, I never have ... but I've never thought
selfishly either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. That's a paradox I don't quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Until women do they'll remain where they
are ... and what they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Oh, I know you hate us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes, dear sister, I'm afraid I do. And I
hate your influence on men ... compromise, tenderness,
pity, lack of purpose. Women don't know the values of
things, not even their own value.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>For a moment she studies him, wonderingly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I'll take up the counter-accusation to-morrow.
Now I'm tired and I'm going to bed. If I may insult you
by mothering you, so should you. You look tired and I've
seldom seen you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I'm waiting up for a message.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. So late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It's a matter of life and death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Are you joking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes. If you want to spoil me find me a
book to read.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. What will you have?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Huckleberry Finn. It's on a top shelf
towards the end somewhere ... or should be.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She finds the book. On her way back with it she
stops and shivers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I don't think I shall sleep to-night. Poor
Amy O'Connell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Curiously.</i>] Are you afraid of death?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With humorous stoicism.</i>] It will be the
end of me, perhaps.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She gives him the book, with its red cover; the '86
edition, a boy's friend evidently. He fingers it
familiarly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Thank you. Mark Twain's a jolly fellow.
He has courage ... comic courage. That's what's wanted.
Nothing stands against it. You be-little yourself by
laughing ... then all this world and the last and the next
grow little too ... and so you grow great again. Switch
off some light, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Clicking off all but his reading lamp.</i>]
So?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Thanks. Good night, Frankie.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She turns at the door, with a glad smile.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Good night. When did you last use that
nursery name?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Then she goes, leaving him still fingering the book,
but looking into the fire and far beyond. Behind him

clear the night is.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No. Good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Oh, my dear ... what is wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The message hasn't come ... and I've been
thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Why don't you tell me? [<i>He turns
his head away.</i>] I think you haven't the right to
torture me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Your sympathy would only blind me towards
the facts I want to face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid</span>. The letters, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>is on his feet at that.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Ah ... I want them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Taking the letters composedly enough.</i>] Thank
you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Simpson</span> <i>departs and</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>comes to her for his
letters. She looks at him with baffled affection.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Can I do nothing? Oh, Henry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Help me to open my letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Don't you leave them to Mr. Kent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Not this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. But there are so many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>For the first time lifting his voice from its
dull monotony.</i>] What a busy man I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Henry ... you're a little mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Do you find me so? That's interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With the ghost of a smile.</i>] Well ...
maddening.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>By this time he is sitting at his table; she near him
watching closely. They halve the considerable post
and start to open it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. We arrange them in three piles ... personal ...
political ... and preposterous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. This is an invitation ... the Anglican
League.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I can't go.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She looks sideways at him, as he goes on mechanically
tearing the envelopes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I heard you come upstairs about two
o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. That was to dip my head in water. Then I
made an instinctive attempt to go to bed ... got my tie off
even.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Her anxiety breaking out.</i>] If you'd tell me
that you're only ill....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Forbiddingly commonplace.</i>] What's that
letter? Don't fuss ... and remember that abnormal
conduct is sometimes quite rational.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>returns to her task with misty eyes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. It's from somebody whose son can't get into
something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The third heap ... Kent's ... the preposterous.
[<i>Talking on with steady monotony.</i>] But I
saw it would not do to interrupt that logical train of
thought which reached definition about half past six. I
had then been gleaning until you came in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Turning the neat little note in her hand.</i>]
This is from Lord Horsham. He writes his name small
at the bottom of the envelope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Without a tremor.</i>] Ah ... give it me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He opens this as he has opened the others, carefully
putting the envelope to one side.</i> <span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>has
ceased for the moment to watch him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. That's Cousin Robert's handwriting. [<i>She
puts a square envelope at his hand.</i>] Is a letter marked
private from the Education Office political or personal?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>By this he has read</i> <span class="smcap">Horsham's</span> <i>letter twice. So he
tears it up and speaks very coldly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Either. It doesn't matter.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>In the silence her fears return.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Henry, it's a foolish idea ... I suppose
I have it because I hardly slept for thinking of her.
Your trouble is nothing to do with Amy O'Connell,
is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His voice strangled in his throat.</i>] Her
child should have been my child too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Her eyes open, the whole landscape of her
mind suddenly clear.</i>] Oh, I ... no, I didn't think so ...
but....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Dealing his second blow as remorselessly as
dealt to him.</i>] Also I'm not joining the new Cabinet, my
dear sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Her thoughts rushing now to the present&mdash;the
future.</i>] Not! Because of...? Do people know?
Will they...? You didn't...?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As mechanically as ever he has taken up</i> <span class="smcap">Cousin
Robert's</span> <i>letter and, in some sense, read it. Now he
recapitulates, meaninglessly, that his voice may just
deaden her pain and his own.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Robert says ... that we've not been to see
them for some time ... but that now I'm a greater man
than ever I must be very busy. The vicarage has been
painted and papered throughout and looks much fresher.
Mary sends you her love and hopes you have no return of
the rheumatism. And he would like to send me the proof
sheets of his critical commentary on First Timothy ... for
my alien eye might possibly detect some logical lapses.
Need he repeat to me his thankfulness at my new attitude
upon Disestablishment ... or assure me again that I
have his prayers. Could we not go and stay there only
for a few days? Possibly his opinion&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She has borne this cruel kindness as long as she can
and she breaks out....</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Oh ... don't ... don't!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He falls from his seeming callousness to the very
blankness of despair.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, we'll leave that ... and the rest ... and
everything.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Her agony passes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. What do you mean to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. There's to be no public scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Why has Lord Horsham thrown you over
then ... or hasn't that anything to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. It has to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Lifting her voice; some tone returning to it.</i>]
Unconsciously ... I've known for years that this sort of
thing might happen to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Power over men and women and contempt
for them! Do you think they don't take their revenge
sooner or later?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Much good may it do them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Human nature turns against you ... by
instinct ... in self-defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. And my own human-nature!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Shocked into great pity, by his half articulate
pain.</i>] Yes ... you must have loved her, Henry ... in
some odd way. I'm sorry for you both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I'm hating her now ... as a man can only
hate his own silliest vices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Flashing into defence.</i>] That's wrong of
you. If you thought of her only as a pretty little fool....
Bearing your child ... all her womanly life belonged to
you ... and for that time there was no other sort of life
in her. So she became what you thought her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. That's not true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. It's true enough ... it's true of men towards
women. You can't think of them through generations
as one thing and then suddenly find them another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Hammering at his fixed idea.</i>] She should
have brought that child into the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. You didn't love her enough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I didn't love her at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Then why should she value your gift?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. For its own sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Turning away.</i>] It's hopeless ... you don't
understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Helpless; almost like a deserted child.</i>]
I've been trying to ... all through the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Turning back enlightened a little.</i>] That's
more the trouble then than the Cabinet question?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He shakes himself to his feet and begins to
pace the room; his keenness coming back to
him, his brow knitting again with the delight of
thought.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Oh ... as to me against the world ...
I'm fortified with comic courage. [<i>Then turning on her
like any examining professor.</i>] Now which do you believe
... that Man is the reformer, or that the Time brings forth
such men as it needs and lobster-like can grow another
claw?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Watching this new mood carefully.</i>] I
believe that you'll be missed from Lord Horsham's
Cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The hand-made statesman and his hand-made
measure! They were out of place in that pretty
Tory garden. Those men are the natural growth of the
time. Am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Just as much. And wasn't your bill going
to be such a good piece of work? That can't be thrown
away ... wasted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Can one impose a clever idea upon men and
women? I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. That rather begs the question of your very
existence, doesn't it?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He comes to a standstill.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I know.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>His voice shows her that meaning in her words and
beyond it a threat. She goes to him, suddenly
shaking with fear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Henry, I didn't mean that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You think I've a mind to put an end to
that same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Belittling her fright.</i>] No ... for how
unreasonable....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. In view of my promising past. I've stood
for success, Fanny; I still stand for success. I could still
do more outside the Cabinet than the rest of them, inside,
will do. But suddenly I've a feeling the work would be
barren. [<i>His eyes shift beyond her; beyond the room.</i>]
What is it in your thoughts and actions which makes them
bear fruit? Something that the roughest peasant may
have in common with the best of us intellectual men ...
something that a dog might have. It isn't successful
cleverness.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She stands ... his trouble beyond her reach.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Come now ... you've done very well with
your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Do you know how empty I feel of all virtue
at this moment?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He leaves her. She must bring him back to the
plane on which she can help him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. We must think what's best to be done ...
now ... and for the future.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Why, I could go on earning useless money
at the Bar ... think how nice that would be. I could
blackmail the next judgeship out of Horsham. I think I
could even smash his Disestablishment Bill ... and perhaps
get into the next Liberal Cabinet and start my own all
over again, with necessary modifications. I shan't do
any such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. No one knows about you and poor Amy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Half a dozen friends. Shall I offer to give
evidence at the inquest this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With a little shiver.</i>] They'll say bad
enough things about her without your blackening her
good name.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Without warning, his anger and anguish break
out again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. All she had ... all there is left of her! She
was a nothingness ... silly ... vain. And I gave her this
power over me!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is beaten, exhausted. Now she goes to him,
motherlike.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. My dear, listen to me for a little. Consider
that as a sorrow and put it behind you. And think
now ... whatever love there may be between us has
neither hatred nor jealousy in it, has it, Henry? Since
I'm not a mistress or a friend but just the likest fellow-creature
to you ... perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Putting out his hand for hers.</i>] Yes, my
sister. What I've wanted to feel for vague humanity has
been what I should have felt for you ... if you'd ever made
a single demand on me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She puts her arms round him; able to speak.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Let's go away somewhere ... I'll make
demands. I need refreshing as much as you. My joy
of life has been withered in me ... oh, for a long time
now. We must kiss the earth again ... take interest in
common things, common people. There's so much of the
world we don't know. There's air to breathe everywhere.
Think of the flowers in a Tyrol valley in the early spring.
One can walk for days, not hurrying, as soon as the passes
are open. And the people are kind. There's Italy ...
there's Russia full of simple folk. When we've learned to
be friends with them we shall both feel so much better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>Shaking his head, unmoved.</i>] My dear
sister ... I should be bored to death. The life contemplative
and peripatetic would literally bore me into a living
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Letting it be a fairy tale.</i>] Is your mother
the Wide World nothing to you? Can't you open your
heart like a child again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. No, neither to the beauty of Nature nor the
particular human animals that are always called a part of
it. I don't even see them with your eyes. I'm a son of
the anger of Man at men's foolishness, and unless I've
that to feed upon...! [<i>Now he looks at her, as if for the first
time wanting to explain himself, and his voice changes.</i>]
Don't you know that when a man cuts himself shaving,
he swears? When he loses a seat in the Cabinet he turns
inward for comfort ... and if he only finds there a spirit
which should have been born, but is dead ... what's to be
done then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>In a whisper.</i>] You mustn't think of that
woman....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. I've reasoned my way through life....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I see how awful it is to have the double blow
fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>The wave of his agony rising again.</i>] But
here's something in me which no knowledge touches ...
some feeling ... some power which should be the beginning
of new strength. But it has been killed in me unborn
before I had learnt to understand ... and that's killing me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Crying out.</i>] Why ... why did no woman
teach you to be gentle? Why did you never believe in any
woman? Perhaps even I am to blame....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. The little fool, the little fool ... why did
she kill my child? What did it matter what I thought
her? We were committed together to that one thing. Do
you think I didn't know that I was heartless and that she
was socially in the wrong? But what did Nature care
for that? And Nature has broken us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Clinging to him as he beats the air.</i>] Not
you. She's dead, poor girl ... but not you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Yes ... that's the mystery no one need believe
till he has dipped in it. The man bears the child in his
soul as the woman carries it in her body.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is silence between them, till she speaks low and
tonelessly, never loosing his hand.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Henry, I want your promise that you'll go on
living till ... till....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Don't cry, Fanny, that's very foolish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Till you've learnt to look at all this calmly.
Then I can trust you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span> <i>smiles, not at all grimly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. But, you see, it would give Horsham and
Blackborough such a shock if I shot myself ... it would
make them think about things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With one catch of wretched laughter.</i>] Oh,
my dear, if shooting's wanted ... shoot them. Or I'll
do it for you.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He sits in his chair just from weariness. She
stands by him, her hand still grasping his.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You see, Fanny, as I said to Gilbert last
night ... our lives are our own and yet not our own. We
understand living for others and dying for others. The
first is easy ... it's a way out of boredom. To make the
second popular we had to invent a belief in personal resurrection.
Do you think we shall ever understand dying
in the sure and certain hope that it really doesn't matter ...
that God is infinitely economical and wastes perhaps less
of the power in us after our death than men do while we
live?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I want your promise, Henry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. You know I never make promises ... it's
taking oneself too seriously. Unless indeed one has the
comic courage to break them too. I've upset you very
much with my troubles. Don't you think you'd better
go and finish dressing? [<i>She doesn't move.</i>] My dear ...
you don't propose to hold my right hand so safely for
years to come. Even so, I still could jump out of a
window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I'll trust you, Henry.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She looks into his eyes and he does not flinch. Then,
with a final grip she leaves him. When she is at the
door he speaks more gently than ever.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Your own life is sufficient unto itself,
isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Oh yes. I can be pleasant to talk to and
give good advice through the years that remain. [<i>Instinctively
she rectifies some little untidiness in the room.</i>]
What fools they are to think they can run that government
without you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Horsham will do his best. [<i>Then, as for the
second time she reaches the door.</i>] Don't take away my
razors, will you? I only use them for shaving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Almost blushing.</i>] I half meant to ... I'm
sorry. After all, Henry, just because they are forgetting
in personal feelings what's best for the country ... it's
your duty not to. You'll stand by and do what you can,
won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. [<i>His queer smile returning, in contrast to her
seriousness.</i>] Disestablishment. It's a very interesting
problem. I must think it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Really puzzled.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He gets up with a quick movement of strange strength,
and faces her. His smile changes into a graver
gladness.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Trebell</span>. Something has happened ... in spite of me.
My heart's clean again. I'm ready for fresh adventures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With a nod and answering gladness.</i>]
That's right.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>So she leaves him, her mind at rest. For a minute
he does not move. When his gaze narrows it falls
on the heaps of letters. He carries them carefully
into</i> <span class="smcap">Walter Kent's</span> <i>room and arranges them as
carefully on his table. On his way out he stops for a
moment; then with a sudden movement bangs the door.</i></p></blockquote>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<blockquote><p><i>Two hours later the room has been put in order. It
is even more full of light and the shadows are harder
than usual. The doors are open, showing you</i> <span class="smcap">Kent's</span>
<i>door still closed. At the big writing table in</i> <span class="smcap">Trebell's</span>
<i>chair sits</i> <span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>, <i>pale and grave, intent on
finishing a letter.</i> <span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>comes to find him. For
a moment she leans on the table silently, her eyes half
closed. You would say a broken woman. When she
speaks it is swiftly, but tonelessly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Lord Horsham is in the drawing room ...
and I can't see him, I really can't. He has come to say
he is sorry ... and I should tell him that it is his fault,
partly. I know I should ... and I don't want to. Won't
you go in? What are you writing?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>, <i>with his physicianly pre-occupation,
can attend, understand, sympathise, without looking
up at her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Never mind. A necessary note ... to
the Coroner's office. Yes, I'll see Horsham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I've managed to get the pistol out of his
hand. Was that wrong ... oughtn't I to have touched it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Of course you oughtn't. You must
stay away from the room. I'd better have locked
the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Pitifully.</i>] I'm sorry ... but I couldn't
bear to see the pistol in his hand. I won't go back. After
all he's not there in the room, is he? But how long do you
think the spirit stays near the body ... how long? When
people die gently of age or weakness.... But when the
spirit and body are so strong and knit together and all
alive as his....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>His hand on hers.</i>] Hush ... hush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. His face is very eager ... as if it still could
speak. I know that.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span> <i>comes through the open doorway.</i>
<span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>hears her steps and turning falls into her
outstretched arms to cry there.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Oh, Julia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Oh my dear Fanny! I came with
Cyril Horsham ... I don't think Simpson even saw me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I can't go in and talk to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. He'll understand. But I heard you
come in here....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I'll tell Horsham.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He has finished and addressed his letter, so he goes
out with it.</i> <span class="smcap">Frances</span> <i>lifts her head. These two
are in accord and can speak their feelings without
disguise or preparation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Julia, Julia ... isn't it unbelievable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I'd give ... oh, what wouldn't I give
to have it undone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I knew he meant to ... and yet I thought
I had his promise. If he really meant to ... I couldn't
have stopped it, could I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Walter sent to tell me and I sent round
to....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Walter came soon after, I think. Julia, I was in
my room ... it was nearly breakfast time ... when I heard
the shot. Oh ... don't you think it was cruel of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. He had a right to. We must remember
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. You say that easily of my brother ... you
wouldn't say it of your husband.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They are apart by this</i>, <span class="smcap">Julia Farrant</span> <i>goes to her
gently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Fanny ... will it leave you so very
lonely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Yes ... lonelier than you can ever be. You
have children. I'm just beginning to realise....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Leading her from the mere selfishness
of sorrow.</i>] There's loneliness of the spirit, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. Ah, but once you've tasted the common joys
of life ... once you've proved all your rights as a man or
a woman....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Then there are subtler things to miss.
As well be alone like you, or dead like him, without them ...
I sometimes think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Responsive, lifted from egoism, reading her
friend's mind.</i>] You demand much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. I wish that he had demanded much of
any woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. You know how this misery began? That
poor little wretch ... she's lying dead too. They're both
dead together now. Do you think they've met...?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>grips both her hands and speaks very steadily
to help her friend back to self control.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. George told me as soon as he was told.
I tried to make him understand my opinion, but he thought
I was only shocked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I was sorry for her. Now I can't forgive
her either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>Angry, remorseful, rebellious.</i>] When
will men learn to know one woman from another?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>With answering bitterness.</i>] When will all
women care to be one thing rather than the other?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They are stopped by the sound of the opening of</i>
<span class="smcap">Kent's</span> <i>door.</i> <span class="smcap">Walter</span> <i>comes from his room, some
papers from his table held listlessly in one hand. He
is crying, undisguisedly, with a child's grief.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. Oh ... am I in your way...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. I didn't know you were still here, Walter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I've been going through the letters as usual. I
don't know why, I'm sure. They won't have to be answered
now ... will they?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span> <i>comes back, grave and tense.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Horsham has gone. He thought perhaps
you'd be staying with Miss Trebell for a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Yes, I shall be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. I must go too ... it's nearly eleven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. To the other inquest?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This stirs her two listeners to something of a
shudder.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>In a low voice.</i>] It will make no
difference now ... I mean ... still nothing need come
out? We needn't know why he ... why he did it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. When he talked to me last night, and
I didn't know what he was talking of....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. He was waiting this morning for Lord
Horsham's note....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. [<i>In real alarm.</i>] Oh, it wasn't because
of the Cabinet trouble ... you must persuade Cyril
Horsham of that. You haven't told him ... he's so
dreadfully upset as it is. I've been swearing it had nothing
to do with that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wedgecroft</span>. [<i>Cutting her short, bitingly.</i>] Has a time
ever come to you when it was easier to die than to go on
living? Oh ... I told Lord Horsham just what I
thought.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He leaves them, his men grief unexpressed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Frances</span>. [<i>Listlessly.</i>] Does it matter why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Farrant</span>. Need there be more suffering and
reproaches? It's not as if even grief would do any good.
[<i>Suddenly with nervous caution.</i>] Walter, you don't know,
do you?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Walter</span> <i>throws up his tear-marked face and a man's
anger banishes the boyish grief.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter</span>. No, I don't know why he did it ... and I
don't care. And grief is no use. I'm angry ... just
angry at the waste of a good man. Look at the work
undone ... think of it! Who is to do it! Oh ... the
waste...!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
